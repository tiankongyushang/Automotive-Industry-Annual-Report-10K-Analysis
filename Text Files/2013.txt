3.D RISK FACTORS

Industry and Business Risks

The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive.

The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive. Toyota faces intense competition from automotive manufacturers in the markets in which it operates. Although the global economy is gradually recovering, competition in the automotive industry has further intensified amidst difficult overall market conditions. In addition, competition is likely to further intensify in light of further continuing globalization in the worldwide automotive industry, possibly resulting in further industry reorganization. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, safety, reliability, fuel economy, the amount of time required for innovation and development, pricing, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle

unit sales, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect Toyota’s financial condition and results of operations. Toyota’s ability to adequately respond to the recent rapid changes in the automotive market and to maintain its competitiveness will be fundamental to its future success in existing and new markets and to maintain its market share. There can be no assurances that Toyota will be able to compete successfully in the future.

The worldwide automotive industry is highly volatile.

Each of the markets in which Toyota competes has been subject to considerable volatility in demand. Demand for vehicles depends to a large extent on social, political and economic conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As Toyota’s revenues are derived from sales in markets worldwide, economic conditions in such markets are particularly important to Toyota. In Japan, while there continues to be some signs of weakness, the economic environment is gradually recovering. In the United States, economic conditions are moderately recovering due to factors such as increased consumer spending. However, in Europe, the economic environment continues to remain stagnant due to the ongoing sovereign debt crisis, and the rate of economic growth is slowing down in emerging economies. Such shifts in demand for automobiles is continuing, and it is unclear how this situation will transition in the future. Toyota’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if the shifts in demand for automobiles continues or progresses further. Demand may also be affected by factors directly impacting vehicle price or the cost of purchasing and operating vehicles such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations (including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes). Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales, which may result in downward price pressure and adversely affect Toyota’s financial condition and results of operations.

Toyota’s future success depends on its ability to offer new innovative competitively priced products that meet customer demand on a timely basis.

Meeting customer demand by introducing attractive new vehicles and reducing the amount of time required for product development are critical to automotive manufacturers. In particular, it is critical to meet customer demand with respect to quality, safety and reliability. The timely introduction of new vehicle models, at competitive prices, meeting rapidly changing customer preferences and demand is more fundamental to Toyota’s success than ever, as the automotive market is rapidly transforming in light of the changing global economy. There is no assurance, however, that Toyota will adequately and appropriately respond to changing customer preferences and demand with respect to quality, safety, reliability, styling and other features in a timely manner. Even if Toyota succeeds in perceiving customer preferences and demand, there is no assurance that Toyota will be capable of developing and manufacturing new, price competitive products in a timely manner with its available technology, intellectual property, sources of raw materials and parts and components, and production capacity, including cost reduction capacity. Further, there is no assurance that Toyota will be able to implement capital expenditures at the level and times planned by management. Toyota’s inability to develop and offer products that meet customers’ preferences and demand with respect to quality, safety, reliability, styling and other features in a timely manner could result in a lower market share and reduced sales volumes and margins, and may adversely affect Toyota’s financial condition and results of operations.

Toyota’s ability to market and distribute effectively is an integral part of Toyota’s successful sales.

Toyota’s success in the sale of vehicles depends on its ability to market and distribute effectively based on distribution networks and sales techniques tailored to the needs of its customers. There is no assurance that Toyota will be able to develop sales techniques and distribution networks that effectively adapt to changing customer preferences or changes in the regulatory environment in the major markets in which it operates. Toyota’s inability to maintain well-developed sales techniques and distribution networks may result in decreased sales and market share and may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.

Toyota’s success is significantly impacted by its ability to maintain and develop its brand image.

In the highly competitive automotive industry, it is critical to maintain and develop a brand image. In order to maintain and develop a brand image, it is necessary to further increase customers’ confidence by providing safe, high-quality products that meet customer preferences and demand. If Toyota is unable to effectively maintain and develop its brand image as a result of its inability to provide safe, high-quality products or as a result of the failure to promptly implement safety measures such as recalls when necessary, vehicle unit sales and/or sale prices may decrease, and as a result revenues and profits may not increase as expected or may decrease, adversely affecting its financial condition and results of operations.

Toyota relies on suppliers for the provision of certain supplies including parts, components and raw materials.

Toyota purchases supplies including parts, components and raw materials from a number of external suppliers located around the world. For some supplies, Toyota relies on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers, whose replacement with another supplier may be difficult. Inability to obtain supplies from a single or limited source supplier may result in difficulty obtaining supplies and may restrict Toyota’s ability to produce vehicles. Furthermore, even if Toyota were to rely on a large number of suppliers, first-tier suppliers with whom Toyota directly transacts may in turn rely on a single second-tier supplier or limited second-tier suppliers. Toyota’s ability to continue to obtain supplies from its suppliers in a timely and cost-effective manner is subject to a number of factors, some of which are not within Toyota’s control. These factors include the ability of Toyota’s suppliers to provide a continued source of supply, and Toyota’s ability to effectively compete and obtain competitive prices from suppliers. A loss of any single or limited source supplier or inability to obtain supplies from suppliers in a timely and cost-effective manner could lead to increased costs or delays or suspensions in Toyota’s production and deliveries, which could have an adverse effect on Toyota’s financial condition and results of operations.

The worldwide financial services industry is highly competitive.

The worldwide financial services industry is highly competitive. Increased competition in automobile financing may lead to decreased margins. A decline in Toyota’s vehicle unit sales, an increase in residual value risk due to lower used vehicle price, an increase in the ratio of credit losses and increased funding costs are factors which may impact Toyota’s financial services operations. If Toyota is unable to adequately respond to the changes and competition in automobile financing, Toyota’s financial services operations may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.

Toyota’s operations and vehicles rely on various digital and information technologies.

Toyota depends on various information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, including sensitive data, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including manufacturing, research and development, supply chain management, sales and accounting. In addition, Toyota’s vehicles may rely on various digital and information technologies, including information service and driving assistance functions. Despite security measures, Toyota’s digital and information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, computer viruses, breaches due to unauthorized use, errors or malfeasance by employees and others who have or gain access to the networks and systems Toyota depends on, service failures or bankruptcy of third parties such as software development or cloud computing vendors, power shortages and outages, and utility failures or other catastrophic events like natural disasters. Such incidents could materially disrupt critical operations, disclose sensitive data, interfere with information services and driving assistance functions in Toyota’s vehicles, and/or give rise to legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under applicable laws, which could have an adverse effect on Toyota’s brand image and its financial condition and results of operations.

Financial Market and Economic Risks

Toyota’s operations are subject to currency and interest rate fluctuations.

Toyota is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and is principally exposed to fluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen, the U.S. dollar and the euro and, to a lesser extent, the Australian dollar, the Russian ruble, the Canadian dollar and the British pound. Toyota’s consolidated financial statements, which are presented in Japanese yen, are affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations through translation risk, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the price of products sold and materials purchased by Toyota in foreign currencies through transaction risk. In particular, strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar can have an adverse effect on Toyota’s operating results.

Toyota believes that its use of certain derivative financial instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps and increased localized production of its products have reduced, but not eliminated, the effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, a negative impact resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates may adversely affect Toyota’s financial condition and results of operations. For a further discussion of currency and interest rate fluctuations and the use of derivative financial instruments, see “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects — Operating Results — Overview — Currency Fluctuations”, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, and notes 20 and 21 to Toyota’s consolidated financial statements.

High prices of raw materials and strong pressure on Toyota’s suppliers could negatively impact Toyota’s profitability.

Increases in prices for raw materials that Toyota and Toyota’s suppliers use in manufacturing their products or parts and components such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous alloys including aluminum, and plastic parts, may lead to higher production costs for parts and components. This could, in turn, negatively impact Toyota’s future profitability because Toyota may not be able to pass all those costs on to its customers or require its suppliers to absorb such costs.

The downturn in the financial markets could adversely affect Toyota’s ability to raise capital.

Should the world economy suddenly deteriorate, a number of financial institutions and investors will face difficulties in providing capital to the financial markets at levels corresponding to their own financial capacity, and, as a result, there is a risk that companies may not be able to raise capital under terms that they would expect to receive with their creditworthiness. If Toyota is unable to raise the necessary capital under appropriate conditions on a timely basis, Toyota’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Political, Regulatory, Legal and Other Risks

The automotive industry is subject to various governmental regulations.

The worldwide automotive industry is subject to various laws and governmental regulations including those related to vehicle safety and environmental matters such as emission levels, fuel economy, noise and pollution. In particular, automotive manufacturers such as Toyota are required to implement safety measures such as recalls for vehicles that do not or may not comply with the safety standards of laws and governmental regulations. In addition, Toyota may, in order to reassure its customers of the safety of Toyota’s vehicles, decide to voluntarily implement recalls or other safety measures even if the vehicle complies with the safety standards of relevant laws and governmental regulations. Many governments also impose tariffs and other trade barriers, taxes and levies, or enact price or exchange controls. Toyota has incurred, and expects to incur in the future, significant costs in complying with these regulations. If Toyota launches products that result in safety measures such as recalls, Toyota may incur various costs including significant costs for free repairs. Furthermore, new legislation or changes in existing legislation may also subject Toyota to additional expenses in the future. If Toyota incurs significant costs related to implementing safety measures or meeting laws and governmental regulations, Toyota’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Toyota may become subject to various legal proceedings.

As an automotive manufacturer, Toyota may become subject to legal proceedings in respect of various issues, including product liability and infringement of intellectual property. Toyota may also be subject to legal proceedings brought by its shareholders and governmental proceedings and investigations. Toyota is in fact currently subject to a number of pending legal proceedings and government investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these pending legal proceedings could adversely affect Toyota’s financial condition and results of operations. For a further discussion of governmental regulations, see “Information on the Company — Business Overview — Governmental Regulation, Environmental and Safety Standards” and for legal proceedings, please see “Information on the Company — Business Overview — Legal Proceedings”.

Toyota may be adversely affected by natural calamities, political and economic instability, fuel shortages or interruptions in social infrastructure, wars, terrorism and labor strikes.

Toyota is subject to various risks associated with conducting business worldwide. These risks include natural calamities; political and economic instability; fuel shortages; interruption in social infrastructure including energy supply, transportation systems, gas, water, or communication systems resulting from natural hazards or technological hazards; wars; terrorism; labor strikes and work stoppages. Should the major markets in which Toyota purchases materials, parts and components and supplies for the manufacture of Toyota products or in which Toyota’s products are produced, distributed or sold be affected by any of these events, it may result in disruptions and delays in the operations of Toyota’s business. Should significant or prolonged disruptions or delays related to Toyota’s business operations occur, it may adversely affect Toyota’s financial condition and results of operations.

During fiscal 2013, 25.7% of Toyota’s automobile unit sales on a consolidated basis were in Japan, 27.8% were in North America, 9.0% were in Europe and 19.0% were in Asia. The remaining 18.5% of consolidated unit sales were in other markets.

The Japanese economy as a whole suffered significant damage as a result of the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011, including the ensuing tsunami and nuclear incident in Fukushima Prefecture.

After the earthquake, Toyota temporarily suspended operations at its domestic and overseas factories due to damage to social infrastructure including energy supply, transportation systems, gas, water and communication systems caused by the earthquake, shortages of parts from suppliers, and damage sustained by some subsidiaries of Toyota in regions adjacent to the disaster zone. Toyota was able to achieve full normalization of production and begin its recovery from the disaster sooner than initially anticipated. Toyota is working to minimize the negative impact on production and company activities that may result from the disaster’s effect on infrastructure, including potential electricity shortages as a result of suspended operations at nuclear power plants throughout Japan.

In addition, with regard to the series of product quality related issues that began in early 2010, in March 2010, Toyota established a Special Committee for Global Quality to thoroughly investigate the cause of the product quality issues and review all of Toyota’s processes, including design, production, sales, service, and human resource development. Toyota believes it is making steady and solid improvements in these regards.

Table of Contents
Building on the work of the Special Committee for Global Quality, each region is implementing comprehensive improvements to the company’s operations and strengthening the company’s quality improvement activities.

Further, in order to obtain objective third-party evaluation, in July 2010, Toyota obtained a report concerning Toyota’s quality-assurance review-and-improvement measures from the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers and external experts recommended by the union. This report evaluated the preventative measures undertaken by Toyota in response to the series of product quality related issues it experienced beginning in early 2010, such as strengthening analysis of customer information and human resource development, and indicated places where these measures should be deepened in order to bring about further improvement. Toyota has received the evaluation with humility, and is making efforts toward further improvements.

Through the quality control approach described above, Toyota and its officers and employees will unite to do their best to make customer safety their first emphasis, ensure that thorough quality control is a constant element of their work, strengthen quality control infrastructure and cultivate customers’ trust. For further details concerning recalls and other safety measures, see “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects — Operating Results — Results of Operations — Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 — Operating Costs and Expenses”.

The Worldwide Automotive Market

Toyota estimates that annual worldwide vehicle sales totaled approximately 82 million units in 2012.

Automobile sales are affected by a number of factors including:

 

 	•	 	
social, political and economic conditions,

 

 	•	 	
introduction of new vehicles and technologies, and

 

 	•	 	
costs incurred by customers to purchase and operate automobiles.

These factors can cause consumer demand to vary substantially from year to year in different geographic markets and in individual categories of automobiles.

The global economy in fiscal 2013 recovered gradually, with recovery in the United States and strong growth in investment and consumption in the emerging markets, especially in Asia, despite downward pressure stemming from the European sovereign debt crisis. The automotive industry was also impacted by this trend. In 2012, markets in emerging countries continued to grow. In developed countries, markets in the United States recovered, increasing by more than 10% compared to the previous year, and the market in Japan increased significantly from the previous year due to the government’s eco-car subsidy program, despite continuing signs of weakness in the overall Japanese economy. European markets fell below the previous year’s levels due to the sluggish economy that resulted partly from the fiscal austerity measures enacted to address the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.

Toyota expects the automotive market to grow in the medium- to long-term driven principally by the growth in resource-rich markets and the emerging markets. Global competition is severe, as competition in compact and low-price vehicles intensifies, and technological development and development of new products become more frequent with a heightened global awareness of the environment.

In 2012, China, Europe, North America, Asia, Central and South America, and Japan were the world’s largest automotive markets. The share of each market across the globe, which Toyota estimates based on the available automobile sales data in each country and region information, was 24% for China, 22% for Europe, 21% for North America (20% excluding Mexico and Puerto Rico), 10% for Asia, 8% for Central and South America, and 7% for Japan. In China, new vehicle sales increased to approximately 19.4 million units. In Europe, new vehicle sales decreased to approximately 18.2 million units. In North America, new vehicle sales increased

 

10

Table of Contents
to approximately 17.2 million units. In Asia (including India but excluding Japan and China), new vehicle unit sales increased to approximately 9.0 million units. In Central and South America, new vehicle sales increased to approximately 6.2 million units. In Japan, total new vehicle unit sales (including mini-vehicles) increased to approximately 5.4 million units.

The worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by government regulations aimed at reducing harmful effects on the environment, enhancing vehicle safety and improving fuel economy. These regulations have added to the cost of manufacturing vehicles. Many governments also mandate local procurement of parts and components and impose tariffs and other trade barriers and price or exchange controls as a means of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers or influencing their balance of payments. Changes in regulatory requirements and other government-imposed restrictions can limit an automaker’s operations. These regulations can also make it difficult to repatriate profits to an automaker’s home country.

The development of the worldwide automotive market includes the continuing globalization of automotive operations. Manufacturers seek to achieve globalization by localizing the design and manufacture of automobiles and their parts and components in the markets in which they are sold. By expanding production capabilities beyond their home markets, automotive manufacturers are able to reduce their exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as well as to trade restrictions and tariffs.

Since 2000, various transactions have promoted consolidation within the global automotive industry. There are various reasons behind these transactions including the need to respond to the excessive global capacity in the production of automobiles, the need to reduce costs and improve efficiency by increasing the number of automobiles produced using common vehicle platforms and by sharing research and development expenses for environmental and other technology, the desire to expand a company’s global presence through increased size and the desire to expand into particular segments or geographic markets. Recently these have included global business alliances and investments between manufacturers.

Toyota believes that its research and development initiatives, particularly the development of environmentally friendly new vehicle technologies, vehicle safety and information technology, provide it with a strategic advantage.

Toyota’s ability to compete in the global automotive industry will depend in part on Toyota’s successful implementation of its business strategy. This is subject to a number of factors, some of which are not in Toyota’s control. These factors are discussed in “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” and elsewhere in this annual report.

Toyota Global Vision

In March 2011, Toyota unveiled its “Toyota Global Vision” corporate outline for the future, which serves not only to give direction to Toyota employees around the world, but also to convey such direction to customers and to the public at large.

As for our future business environment, the world economy is expected to benefit from ongoing moderate recovery in the U.S. and a pickup in the pace of economic expansion in emerging countries. Europe, meanwhile, still faces the risk of economic stagnation due to the sovereign debt crisis and other factors, though a gradual bottoming out is anticipated. The Japanese economy is expected to move gradually towards recovery supported by the effect of the policy package and monetary policy. However, slowing down of overseas economies is still downside risk of the Japanese economy.

The automotive market is expected to see recovery in the U.S. and expansion in emerging countries. However, amid the change in market structure, as seen in the expansion and diversification of demand for eco-cars backed by rising environmental consciousness, fierce competition exists on a global scale.

In this severe business environment, the Toyota group as a whole is responding to changes flexibly and is progressing steadily toward the realization of the Toyota Global Vision announced in March 2011. We will continue to review the structure for realizing sustainable growth and achieving competitiveness, and the Toyota group as a whole will make greater efforts to address the following:

First, we will further promote the Toyota New Global Architecture (“TNGA”), the way we will fundamentally reconsider work procedures, in order to launch attractive products globally and in a timely manner. For the Toyota brand, we intend to plan and develop overwhelmingly competitive next-generation cars in advanced countries, and to develop and introduce good products at affordable price that are trusted by customers in various usage environments in emerging countries. For the Lexus brand, we intend to establish the image as a global premium brand that hails from Japan. Furthermore, we intend to bring competitive units promptly.

Second, we intend to flexibly overcome business and management environmental changes. We will promote new business such as environmental and energy solutions that will lead the next generation and make strategic preparations for future business activities in next emerging countries. To better implement these efforts, we intend to improve the foundations for speedy decision-making and encourage appropriate control of fixed costs.

Third, we intend to proceed with constant activities toward the achievement of sustainable growth. In addition to pursuing quality improvement, we intend to further strengthen our innovative cost-reduction and profit-improvement activities throughout the company and promote further human resource development for enhancement of our global competitiveness. Activities to improve business continuity in the event of large-scale disasters will also be promoted and established.

Based on these efforts, Toyota will contribute to realize “enriching lives of communities” through providing “ever-better cars” that exceed customer expectations. This is expected to encourage more customers to purchase Toyota cars and thereby lead to the establishment of a stable business base. By perpetuating this good cycle, we will aim to realize sustainable growth and enhance corporate value. In addition, through full observance of corporate ethics such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Toyota will fulfill its social responsibilities by carrying out its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).

Vehicle Models

Toyota’s vehicles (produced by Toyota, Daihatsu and Hino) can be classified into two categories: hybrid vehicles and conventional engine vehicles. Toyota’s product line-up includes subcompact and compact cars, mini-vehicles, mid-size, luxury, sports and specialty cars, recreational and sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks, minivans, trucks and buses.

Hybrid Vehicles

The world’s first mass-produced hybrid car was Toyota’s Prius. It runs on an efficient combination of a gasoline engine and motor. This system allows the Prius to travel more efficiently than conventional engine vehicles of comparable size and performance. The hybrid design of the Prius also results in the output of 75% less emission than the maximum amount allowed by Japanese environmental regulations. Toyota views the Prius as the cornerstone of its emphasis on designing and producing eco-friendly automobiles. As of the end of March 2013, the total number of Toyota’s hybrid vehicles sold was 5.097 million units.

In May 2008, Toyota introduced the hybrid version of the Crown, which is the signature model of the Toyota brand, in Japan. In April 2009, the Lexus RX450h, which is the fully-remodeled Lexus RX400h, was successively introduced in Japan, North America and Europe. The Prius, of which 3.181 million units have been sold (as of the end of March 2013) since it was first introduced in 1997 and whose name has become synonymous with hybrid vehicles, underwent its second full model change in May 2009. The hybrid vehicles HS250h and SAI were introduced in July 2009 and December 2009, respectively. In December 2009, Toyota began leasing the Prius plug-in hybrid equipped with a lithium ion battery targeted at certain corporate users including electrical power companies. In January 2011, the Lexus hybrid vehicle CT200h was also introduced. Further, Toyota introduced the Prius a (Prius Alpha) wagon in May 2011 and is planning further ways to enhance the Prius series lineup. Furthermore, Toyota has strengthened its hybrid lineup by introducing hybrid versions of the Camry in September 2011, the Alphard and the Vellfire in November 2011, the compact hybrid vehicle Aqua in December 2011, the Prius plug-in and the fully remodeled GS450h in January 2012, the Yaris HV in May 2012, ES300h in July 2012, the Auris HV in November 2012 and the Avalon HV and the fully remodeled Crown HV in December 2012. Toyota anticipates strong growth in the hybrid vehicles area and will continue to introduce new models.

Toyota began limited sales of a fuel cell hybrid vehicle in Japan and the United States in December 2002. In June 2005, Toyota’s new fuel cell hybrid passenger vehicle became the first in Japan to acquire vehicle type certification under the Road Vehicles Act, as amended, on March 31, 2005, by Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Leases for the vehicle began in July 2005. By 2007, Toyota was able to make improvements to start-up and cruising distance at temperatures below freezing, which were technological challenges. Toyota has made advances by solving technological issues such as the above and has been working towards the practical use of such solutions.

Toyota aims to continue its efforts to offer a diverse line-up of hybrid vehicles, enhance engine power while improving fuel economy and otherwise work towards increasing the sales of hybrid vehicles.

For this reason, Toyota is promoting next generation environmentally friendly, energy efficient, and safe vehicle technology in its research and development. Toyota is making efforts to produce vehicles that are friendly to the environment and human beings, with efforts focused in the following fields:

 

 	•	 	
further improvements in hybrid technologies (functions, costs, etc.) and subsequent environmental contributions;

 

 	•	 	
improvement in gasoline engine fuel economy and improvement of technology in connection with more stringent emissions standards;

 

 	•	 	
promoting improvements in clean diesel engine functioning and fuel economy;

 

 	•	 	
development of electric vehicles, fuel-electric vehicles and other alternative fuel vehicles; and

 

 	•	 	
development of technology designed to promote driving and vehicle safety.

Toyota’s belief is that the environment is one of the most important issues. Toyota is aiming to lower the volume of carbon dioxide emissions at all stages of operations, including development, production, logistics, usage, disposal and recycling of vehicles, as well as the reduction of environmental burdens. Toyota also utilizes various energy resources as a substitute to oil, and has successfully developed a plug-in hybrid vehicle which can be charged from domestic power supplies. Toyota is committed to realize the mass production of electric vehicles, the development of next-generation batteries, and the development of alternative fuel vehicles such as biofuel and fuel-cell vehicles. Toyota aims to maintain its leadership position in environmental technology, and is responding to environmental issues, the representative example being the Prius, the hybrid car introduced to the Japanese market in 1997.

In May 2010, Toyota invested in Tesla Motors, Inc. (“Tesla”) in the amount of $50 million as part of a basic agreement with Tesla to implement a joint venture related to the development, technology, and production systems of electric vehicles and their components. At the 26th International Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium held in May 2012, Toyota announced the jointly developed electric vehicle, the RAV4 EV, which was released in California in summer 2012.

Toyota’s research and development activities focus on the environment, vehicle safety, information technology and product development.

Toyota’s environmental research and development activities focus on:

 

 	•	 	
Developing light-weight and more fuel-efficient engines and transmissions. These technologies include improved technologies in fuel economy, emission, and performance, such as the development of next-generation direct injection system and variable valve system for gasoline engines and the development of the next-generation ultra high pressure common rail system and the diesel particulate and nitrous oxide reduction system for diesel engines.

 

 	•	 	
Developing alternative fuel powering systems for commercial sale. This includes developing hybrid vehicles and fuel cell hybrid vehicles. The second-generation Prius that Toyota introduced in September 2003 features a new hybrid system which decreases negative environmental impact while increasing power and performance. Furthermore, the third-generation Prius was introduced in 2009, and broke the record for sales by vehicle type which was previously held by the Corolla. The Aqua (called Prius c in the US), introduced in December 2011 and sold in approximately 50 countries worldwide, is a world leader in fuel economy and low pricing. In addition, Toyota’s cumulative sales of hybrid vehicles has exceeded 5 million units, which contributed approximately 34 million ton reduction in CO2 emissions. In July 2007, Toyota developed the Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle (“PHV”) and received certification from Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (“MLIT”). PHV runs as an Electric Vehicle (“EV”) in short distances and runs as a regular hybrid vehicle in long distances. Tests are conducted in Japan, North America and Europe and in late 2009, Toyota commenced its sale of PHV with lithium ion batteries to fleet vehicle users in Japan, North America and Europe. Toyota also commenced its sale of PHV models in January 2012, which can be charged

from domestic power supplies in Japan, North America and Europe. In addition, in September 2008, Toyota started leasing the new Toyota Fuel Cell Hybrid Vehicle — advanced (the “new Toyota FCHV-adv”). The new Toyota FCHV-adv has completely overhauled its fuel cell system and has made significant improvements to low-temperature startup performance and cruising distance, which had posed challenges to promoting its widespread use. Toyota believes that fuel cell vehicles will be strong eco-cars for future generations. By 2015, Toyota plans to introduce sedan-type fuel cell vehicles at reasonable prices for customers in Japan, the United States and Europe where appropriate infrastructure is expected to be available. To control increases in oil prices and reduce the consumption of oil, the proliferation of fuel alternatives to oil such as biofuel and natural gas is expanding in some countries. Toyota works towards the ongoing formation of a mobility society through the introduction to the market of low-ethanol content vehicles (“E10”), natural gas vehicles and high-concentration flex-fuel vehicles (“FFV”) that are compatible with ethanol fuel, as well as through research and development into other practical uses of oil alternatives and biofuels, such as research into fuels that will not compete with food production, and into genetically modified organism (“GMO”) technology in order to process sugarcane more efficiently.

Engaging in recycling activities that take into account the lifecycle (development, manufacture, use, disposal) of a vehicle. Research and development focuses primarily on (1) developing materials that are suitable for recycling and designs that facilitate dismantling parts, and (2) research on effective dismantling technology of end-of-life vehicles and use of recycle materials.

Toyota’s work in the area of vehicle safety is focused on the development of technologies designed to prevent accidents in the first instance, as well as the development of technologies that protect passengers and reduce the damage on impact in the event of an accident. Safety technologies in development include:

 

 	•	 	
research on protecting diverse passengers, including senior citizens,

 

 	•	 	
autonomous driving support systems, including pre-collision system, and

 

 	•	 	
data exchange driving-support systems using advanced communication technologies.

To expand the frontiers of safety technology in automobiles, Toyota completed in 1995 its first prototype Advanced Safety Vehicle, the ASV-1. The ASV-2, which was introduced in 2000, incorporates emerging technologies, such as an autonomous safety support system that uses CCD stereo cameras to recognize obstacles in traffic lanes and an infrastructure-harmonized safety support system to warn the driver of pedestrian crossings. In 2002, Toyota conducted road testing of the ASV-3, a prototype based on further improved infrastructure-harmonized system. With the February 2003 introduction of the Harrier in Japan, Toyota became the first car manufacturer to implement a pre-collision system in its automobiles. This advanced system utilizes pre-collision sensors that use millimeter wave radar and cameras to detect objects presenting hazards, and in addition to alerting the driver to the danger of potential collisions, this system employs a brake assist mechanism that utilizes power-assisted braking to minimize the speed on impact, and automatically applies the vehicle’s brakes when a collision is determined to be inevitable. In February 2004, Toyota introduced the pre-collision system for the first time in the United States by equipping the LS430 with the above features.

In September 2006, at the time of introduction of LS460 in Japan, Toyota established the world’s first enhanced pre-collision system, which added functions to detect pedestrians in front, to support driver steering, and to react to vehicle collision.

In February 2008, Toyota developed the world’s first driver monitoring pre-collision system for the Crown sold in Japan, that monitors whether the driver’s eyes are open, in addition to the face monitor which monitors the direction in which the driver is facing.

In addition, in 2011, Toyota established the Collaborative Safety Research Center aimed at reducing the number of traffic accident related deaths through cooperation with various hospitals and universities in North America. Toyota is greatly fortifying its efforts toward product safety and quality, and this research center is part of these efforts. Established within the same research center is the Toyota Technical Center (“TTC”), which is

 

89

Table of Contents
the research and development center of Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America, Inc. At the TTC, Toyota’s technicians based in Japan also take part in planning, and perform research focused on reducing the risk of distracted or impaired driving behaviors, as well as the protection of vulnerable demographics such as young children and the elderly. Toyota is also promoting the spread of safe vehicle technologies, and is implementing analyses of traffic accident and driver behavior data. Toyota is planning to invest in the amount of 50 million dollars over the next 5 years, starting from 2011.

In order to promote further streamlining of the global external decision-making process with respect to the development of vehicle safety technologies, Toyota appointed a Chief Safety Technology Officer (“CSTO”) in 2011, who will execute a general integration of safety technology within Toyota’s technology department.

Toyota’s product development program uses a series of methods which are generally intended to promote timely and appropriate responses to changing market demand. These methods include:

 

 	•	 	
optimizing and eliminating vehicle platforms,

 

 	•	 	
sharing parts and components among multiple vehicles,

 

 	•	 	
shortening the time for development and production preparation by the simultaneous study of design and production engineering processes, and

 

 	•	 	
using simulation technology for production design and evaluation.

Toyota carefully analyzes patents and the need for patents in each area of research to formulate more effective research and development strategies. Toyota identifies research and development projects in which it should acquire patents, and files relevant applications as necessary to help build a strong global patent portfolio.

In addition, Toyota wishes to contribute to sustainable mobility by promoting the spread of technologies with environmental and safety benefits. This is why Toyota takes an open stance to patent licensing, and grants licenses when appropriate terms are met. For example, in March 2004, Toyota and Ford Motor Company entered into licensing agreements for patents related to hybrid systems and emissions purification. In addition, in March 2010, Toyota and Mazda Motor Corporation entered into a licensing agreement regarding the supply of hybrid system technology.

Toyota does not consider any one group of patents or licenses to be so important that their expiration or termination would materially affect Toyota’s business. For a further discussion of Toyota’s intellectual property, see “Information on the Company — Business Overview — Intellectual Property”.

5.D TREND INFORMATION

For a discussion of the trends that affect Toyota’s business and operating results, see “— Operating Results” and “— Liquidity and Capital Resources”.

5.E OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Toyota uses its securitization program as part of its funding through special purpose entities for its financial services operations. Toyota is considered the primary beneficiary of these special purpose entities and therefore consolidates them. Toyota has not entered into any off-balance sheet securitization transactions during fiscal 2013.

Lending Commitments

Credit Facilities with Credit Card Holders

Toyota’s financial services operations issue credit cards to customers. As customary for credit card businesses, Toyota maintains credit facilities with holders of credit cards issued by Toyota. These facilities are

 

90

Table of Contents
used upon each holder’s requests up to the limits established on an individual holder’s basis. Although loans made to customers through these facilities are not secured, for the purposes of minimizing credit risks and of appropriately establishing credit limits for each individual credit card holder, Toyota employs its own risk management policy which includes an analysis of information provided by financial institutions in alliance with Toyota. Toyota periodically reviews and revises, as appropriate, these credit limits. Outstanding credit facilities with credit card holders were ¥245.2 billion as of March 31, 2013.

Credit Facilities with Dealers

Toyota’s financial services operations maintain credit facilities with dealers. These credit facilities may be used for business acquisitions, facilities refurbishment, real estate purchases, and working capital requirements. These loans are typically collateralized with liens on real estate, vehicle inventory, and/or other dealership assets, as appropriate. Toyota obtains a personal guarantee from the dealer or corporate guarantee from the dealership when deemed prudent. Although the loans are typically collateralized or guaranteed, the value of the underlying collateral or guarantees may not be sufficient to cover Toyota’s exposure under such agreements. Toyota prices the credit facilities according to the risks assumed in entering into the credit facility. Toyota’s financial services operations also provide financing to various multi-franchise dealer organizations, referred to as dealer groups, often as part of a lending consortium, for wholesale inventory financing, business acquisitions, facilities refurbishment, real estate purchases, and working capital requirements. Toyota’s outstanding credit facilities with dealers totaled ¥1,795.8 billion as of March 31, 2013.

Guarantees

Toyota enters into certain guarantee contracts with its dealers to guarantee customers’ payments of their installment payables that arise from installment contracts between customers and Toyota dealers, as and when requested by Toyota dealers. Guarantee periods are set to match the maturity of installment payments, and as of March 31, 2013, ranged from one month to 35 years. However, they are generally shorter than the useful lives of products sold. Toyota is required to execute its guarantee primarily when customers are unable to make required payments.

The maximum potential amount of future payments as of March 31, 2013 is ¥1,849.4 billion. Liabilities for these guarantees of ¥6.5 billion have been provided as of March 31, 2013. Under these guarantee contracts, Toyota is entitled to recover any amounts paid by it from the customers whose obligations it guaranteed.
ITEM 1.	BUSINESS
Overview

We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We have established our own network of sales and service centers and Supercharger stations globally thus creating a unique business model in the automobile industry. We have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers.

We are currently producing and selling our second vehicle, the Model S sedan. Model S is a four door, five-passenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. The Model S inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster which was launched in 2008 and was the first commercially produced and federally compliant EV in the United States. We completed production of approximately 2,500 Tesla Roadsters in January 2012 and began deliveries of Model S in June 2012. As of December 31, 2013, we have delivered over 25,000 Model S vehicles in North America and Europe. In 2014, we expect to grow our presence in several international markets with deliveries to commence in China, Japan, the United Kingdom and Australia. Since its launch, Model S has won several awards, including the prestigious Motor Trend Car of the Year for 2013. In November 2013, Model S received 99 out of 100 in an owner survey conducted by Consumer Reports, the highest customer satisfaction score of any car in the world. Our goal is to deliver the highest possible level of ownership satisfaction in every way.

We are adapting the platform architecture of Model S to develop our Model X crossover. This unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an SUV, while having high performance features such as a dual motor all-wheel drive system. We revealed a prototype of Model X in February 2012. We currently expect to have production design Model X prototypes on the road by end of year and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015. We have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle, to which we refer as 揋en III? which we intend to offer at a lower price point and produce at higher volumes than our Model S in approximately three years.

We are also building a network of Superchargers in the United States and Europe to enable free and convenient long distance driving. Superchargers allow Model S owners to replenish 50% of the battery pack in as little as 20 minutes. Supercharger stations are strategically placed along well-travelled highways to allow Model S owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient, minimal stops. As of February 19, 2014, we had 90 Supercharger stations open in North America and Europe. We plan to continue to open Supercharger stations in these regions as well as in Asia during 2014 and expect to triple our Supercharger stations during 2014. We expect that Model X and our future cars will be able to use this network.

We sell and service our electric vehicles through our company-owned sales and service network in North America, Europe and Asia. Our intent is to offer a compelling customer experience while gathering rapid customer feedback and achieving operating efficiencies, better control over the costs of inventory, warranty service, pricing, and the development of the Tesla brand. Our Tesla stores do not carry large vehicle inventories and, as a result, do not require corresponding large floor spaces. We believe the benefits we receive from distribution ownership will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business. We believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage as compared to incumbent automobile manufacturers.

In addition to developing our own vehicles, we provide services for the development of full electric powertrain systems and components, and sell electric powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers. We have provided development services and powertrain components to Daimler AG (Daimler) for its Smart fortwo, A-Class, and B-Class electric vehicles. We also have developed a full electric powertrain system for

Table of Contents
Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) for use in its RAV4 EV and began shipping production components to Toyota in 2012. We also plan to start selling stationary energy storage products for use in homes, commercial sites, and utilities. The applications for these battery systems include backup power, peak demand reduction, demand response, and wholesale electric market services.

We conduct our powertrain and vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations at the Tesla Factory, our integrated manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, and at our facility in Tilburg, Netherlands. We have recently indicated our intention to build the Tesla Gigafactory, a facility in the United States where we intend to manufacture cells and battery packs for our vehicles and our stationary storage applications.

Our fully electric vehicles combine zero tailpipe emissions, market leading range on a single charge, impressive acceleration, and pricing competitive with other vehicles in their classes. For example, our Model S accelerates from zero to 60 miles per hour in as little as 4.2 seconds and has a range on a single charge of up to 265 miles. We offer Model S with 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options. Model S has an effective base price of $62,400 and $72,400 in the United States for the 60 kWh and 85 kWh options, respectively, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even without the tax credit, we believe our list prices are competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium vehicles. We believe that Model S demonstrates our ability to produce increasingly affordable electric vehicles that offer long-range capabilities and uncompromised performance, energy efficiency, convenience and design.

The commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers?range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles. Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and software engineering. We have complemented this talent base with automotive engineers with substantial expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing. Our ability to combine expertise in electric powertrain and vehicle engineering provides a broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration. We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and highly vertical manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.

Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery packs use custom electric vehicle lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio梐s of December 31, 2013, we had 203 issued patents and more than 280 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas, including the battery pack and other technologies.

We are designing our vehicles to enable the cost effective development of our future vehicles. For example, we have designed Model S with a platform architecture, which compactly positions the battery pack, motor and other elements of our powertrain within the frame of the vehicle. We believe this architecture may form the basis of several future vehicles, including our planned Model X, and enable us to efficiently and cost effectively launch these new vehicle models in the future.

Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe

overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles. As a result, we believe our customers enjoy several benefits, including:

 

 	? 	
Long Range and Recharging Flexibility. Our vehicles offer ranges that are over double the range of any other commercially available electric vehicle. In addition, our vehicles incorporate our proprietary on-board charging system, permitting recharging from almost any available electrical outlet. Our Model S vehicles also offer fast charging capability from our Supercharger network. We believe the long-range and charging flexibility of our vehicles will help reduce consumer anxiety over range, alleviate the need for expensive, large-scale charging infrastructure, and differentiate our vehicles as compared to our competitors?currently announced electric vehicle product offerings.

 

 	? 	
Energy Efficiency and Cost of Ownership. We believe our vehicles offer consumers an attractive cost of ownership when compared to similar internal combustion engine or hybrid electric vehicles. Using only a single electric powertrain enables us to create a lighter, more energy efficient vehicle that is mechanically simpler than currently available hybrid or internal combustion engine vehicles. We currently estimate that the cost to fuel our vehicles is approximately one-fifth that of comparable internal combustion vehicles in the United States, and even less internationally where gasoline prices are typically higher. We also expect our electric vehicles will have lower relative maintenance costs than hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or internal combustion engine vehicles due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves. Additionally, government incentives that are currently available can reduce the cost of ownership even further.

 

 	? 	
High-Performance Without Compromised Design or Functionality. We believe we have been able to successfully overcome the design and performance tradeoff issues that encumbered most early electric vehicle designs. We believe our vehicles deliver unparalleled driving experiences with instantaneous and sustained acceleration through an extended range of speed. In addition, our Model S seats five adults, provides best in class storage in the trunk and hood while offering design and performance comparable to, or better than, other premium sedans.

Our Vehicles and Products

We currently design, develop, manufacture and sell fully electric vehicles and electric powertrain components. We are currently selling primarily the Model S.

Model S

Model S is a fully electric, four-door, five-adult passenger sedan that offers compelling range and performance with zero tailpipe emissions. We began customer deliveries in June 2012. As of December 31, 2013, we had delivered over 25,000 Model S vehicles.

Model S offers a range on a single charge of up to 265 miles. To complement this range, we also offer the capability to fast charge Model S at our Supercharger facilities. In addition, we designed Model S to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle, enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at certain of our service centers and specialized commercial battery exchange facilities that we anticipate may be available in the future.

We believe Model S offers a unique combination of functionality, convenience, safety and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency. With the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle, Model S provides best in class storage space of 31.6 cubic feet, including storage under both the tailgate and the hood. By way of comparison, this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2014 BMW 5 Series sedan and the approximately 18 cubic feet of storage available in the 2014 Cadillac XTS. In addition, we have designed Model S to include a third row with two rear-facing child seats, allowing us to offer seating for five adults and two children. Model S is also available with premium luxury features, including a 17 inch touch screen driver interface, advanced

wireless connectivity, such as 3G connectivity, and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle. We designed Model S to be incorporate new functionality through wireless updates, which allows us to continually improve Model S over time. Model S has also achieved a five star safety rating. We believe the combination of performance, safety, styling, convenience and energy efficiency of Model S positions it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments.

The 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options of Model S have an effective base price of $62,400, and $72,400, respectively, in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. We also offer a performance version of Model S for an effective base price of $85,900.

We have designed Model S to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class. We consider the purchase price, cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation. We assume comparable residual values, warranties, insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a Model S purchase. In addition to the competitive pricing of Model S relative to other premium vehicles, we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs. For example, assuming an average of 15,000 miles driven per year, an average electricity cost of 11.8 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price of $3.24 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and gasoline price in the United States, respectively, for December 2013, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of Model S, we estimate that our Model S could save approximately $1,800 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. In international markets, where gasoline prices can be 2-3 times those of the United States, the savings are greater. Furthermore, we expect Model S will have lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves.

We have designed Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain that we intend to leverage to create future electric vehicle models, including our Model X. In particular, by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle body styles, we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development. In addition, we believe our strategy of using currently available battery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce planned vehicles with different range options.

The Tesla Roadster

Our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, is the first high-performance electric sports car. The two-seat, convertible Tesla Roadster has a combination of range, style, performance and energy efficiency that we believe is unmatched in the market today. It can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in as little as 3.7 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. The Tesla Roadster also has a range of 245 miles on a single charge, as determined using the United States EPA抯 combined two-cycle city/highway test. We have sold approximately 2,500 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries, predominately in North America and Europe. We concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster in January 2012.

Model X

In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. This unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an SUV, while having high performance features such as a dual motor all-wheel drive system. Model X will seat seven adults. We anticipate that we will make Model X available with 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options, with pricing of each version similar to those of a comparably equipped Model S. We currently intend to target an initial annual production rate of approximately 20,000 vehicles per year from our Tesla Factory. We expect to have production design Model X prototypes on the road by end of

Table of Contents
2014 and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015. After its initial launch in the United States, Model X will be sold in all the markets where Model S is available including in Asia and Europe.

Gen III

We have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle, to which we refer as 揋en III? to be produced at the Tesla Factory. We intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our Model S. We expect that this vehicle will be produced in approximately three years.

Powertrain Development and Sales

In addition to our own vehicles, we also design, develop, manufacture and sell advanced electric vehicle powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers.

We have provided development services and full powertrain systems and components to Daimler for its Smart fortwo, A-Class, and B-Class electric vehicles. From May 2009 through December 2012, we provided approximately 2,700 battery packs and chargers for the Smart fortwo and A-Class vehicles. We have completed these programs and are now providing development services to Daimler for its B-Class electric vehicle. We also have developed a full electric powertrain system for Toyota for use in its RAV4 EV and began shipping production systems to Toyota in 2012. As of December 31, 2013 we have shipped over 1,600 units.

We are continuing to perform our electric powertrain component and systems sales and marketing activities principally out of our Palo Alto facility. This facility, which also serves as our corporate headquarters, houses our research and development services, including cell and component testing and prototyping, as well as manufacturing of powertrain components for sales to third parties. Manufacturing of our powertrain components is performed at the Tesla Factory.

Stationary Energy Storage Applications

In 2013, we developed stationary energy storage products for use in homes, commercial sites and utilities. The applications for these battery systems include backup power, peak demand reduction, demand response and wholesale electric market services. We plan to ramp sales of these products in 2014.

Technology

We believe the core competencies of our company are powertrain, vehicle engineering and innovative manufacturing. Our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain and the ability to design a vehicle which capitalizes on the uniqueness of an electric powertrain. Our electric powertrain consists of the following: battery pack, power electronics, motor, gearbox and the control software which enables the components to operate as a system. We designed each of these major elements for our Tesla Roadster and Model S and plan to use much of this technology in Model X, Gen III, our future electric vehicles and powertrain components that we build for other manufacturers. Our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design, enabling future generations of electric vehicles to incorporate a significant amount of this technology. Further, our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain. These features enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications, including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other manufacturers.

Battery Pack

We design our battery packs to safely store significant amounts of energy and to have long lives. For example, we have designed our Tesla Roadster battery packs to store 53 kilowatt hours of useful energy and to

 

8

Table of Contents
have an estimated life of over 100,000 miles or seven years. In addition, we have designed our battery packs to be modular so that we can leverage technology developments across our different vehicles and products. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, robotic manufacturing processes, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. We have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management systems needed to work with lithium-ion cells in the demanding automotive environment. We believe these advancements have enabled us to produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatt-hour.

We believe one of our core competencies is the design of our complete battery pack system. We have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry, form factor and vendor that we adopt for battery cell supply. In so doing, we believe that we can leverage the substantial battery cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve the cost per kilowatt-hour of our battery pack. We maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithium-ion cell vendors and chemistry types. We intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs, and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity, longevity, power delivery and cost. We believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable, and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles. We believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software, electronics, testing and vehicle packaging, will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology.

The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. Customers?use of their Tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery抯 ability to hold a charge. For example, we currently expect that the Tesla Roadster battery pack will retain approximately 70% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle抯 initial range. In comparison with the Roadster battery pack, we expect that the retention rate of the Model S battery pack is greater, due to improvements at the battery cell and pack level. In addition, based on internal testing, we estimate that the Model S would have an approximate 5-10% reduction in range when operated continuously in 0癈 temperatures.

To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries, form factors and designs. Based on this evaluation, we are presently using lithium-ion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs. We intend to use the same battery cell form factor in Model X. We entered into a supply agreement with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) for the use of Panasonic抯 battery cells in Model S and Model X. We expect these battery cells to exhibit better performance and longer lifetimes than the battery cells used in the Tesla Roadster.

Power Electronics

The power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car, primarily the current that flows into and out of the battery pack. The power electronics have two primary functions, the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging.

The first function is accomplished through the drive inverter, which converts direct current (DC) from the battery pack into alternating current (AC) to drive our three-phase induction motors. The drive inverter also converts the AC generated by regenerative braking back into DC for electrical storage in the battery pack. The drive inverter performs this function by using a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle. In so doing, the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance, high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle.

The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source) into direct current that can be accepted by the battery. Tesla vehicles can recharge on a variety of AC electrical outlets, from a common outlet of 15 amps and 120 volts up to a high power circuit of 80 amps and 240 volts, which provides faster recharging. The most common home charging system uses a 14-50 type outlet at 40 amps and 240 volts to recharge at an EPA equivalent rate of 29 miles per hour of charge time.

In the United States, Model S vehicles are delivered with an SAE 1772 industry standard adapter that enables public AC charging at thousands of stations. The European version of Model S has an industry standard vehicle inlet connector that is also compatible with public charge stations around Europe. Vehicles in both the United States and Europe also come with the Tesla Mobile Connector which enables charging from a variety of different outlets for customers who want a portable solution with maximum flexibility. For the fastest possible charging, we offer a high-voltage, direct current option for Model S that enables the vehicle to charge from Tesla抯 Supercharger network. Superchargers are able to replenish 50% of the battery pack in as little as 20 minutes of charge time. This flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility, while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home.

Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software

The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the 揷reep?feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. Drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally.

Vehicle Design and Engineering

In addition to the design, development and production of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems. We design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models.

Several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle. For example, we redesigned the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine. In addition, low voltage electric systems which power features such as the radio, power windows, and heated seats also needed to be designed specifically for use in an electric vehicle. We have developed expertise in integrating these components with the high-voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack, thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle.

Additionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range. The Tesla Roadster is built with an internally-designed carbon fiber body which provides a balance of strength and mass. Model S is built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporates a variety of materials and production methods that help optimize the weight of the vehicle.

Sales and Marketing

Company-Owned Stores and Galleries

We market and sell cars directly to consumers through an international network of company-owned stores and galleries. Our Tesla stores and galleries are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets, some of which combine retail sales and service. We have also found that opening a service center in a new geographic area can increase demand. As a result, we have complemented our store strategy with sales facilities and personnel in service centers to more rapidly expand our retail footprint. We refer to these as 揝ervice Plus?locations. Including our Service Plus locations, we now operate a network of over 80 sales and gallery locations in North America, Europe and Asia. Including all of our sales and service facilities, we currently operate 116 locations. We intend to grow our sales and service network by approximately 75% during the year ending December 31, 2014.

We believe that by owning our own sales and service network we can offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues incumbent automobile manufacturers do not enjoy in the traditional franchised distribution and service model. Our customers deal directly with our own Tesla-employed sales and service staff, creating what we believe is a differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers. We believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer feedback. Further, we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer.

Tesla Supercharger Network

We are building a network of up to 120 kWh fast charging equipment, each called a Tesla Supercharger, throughout North America and Europe for fast charging of Model S. The Tesla Supercharger is an industrial grade, high speed charger designed to replenish 50% of the battery pack in as little as 20 minutes. Supercharger stations are strategically placed along well-travelled highways to allow Model S owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient, minimal stops. As of February 19, 2014, we have 90 Supercharger stations open in North America and Europe. In the United States, we have implemented Superchargers across a major transcontinental route, as well as along key routes in the East and West Coasts. In Europe, Superchargers enable long distance travel along key routes in Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Access to the Supercharger network is currently available free of charge to owners of Model S vehicles with the 85 kWh battery pack options and when purchased as an upfront option for 60 kWh. We are planning to methodically expand the Supercharger network over the next few years in the United States, Europe and Asia.

Deposits and Reservations

We typically carry a limited inventory of our Model S vehicles at our Tesla stores. While some customers may purchase their vehicles from this inventory, most of our customers choose to customize the appearance of their vehicle. We require a refundable $2,500 deposit for these orders of our Model S vehicles, which is collected once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and has entered into a purchase agreement. The refundable deposit becomes nonrefundable after two weeks. We require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer.

For Model X, which is currently not in production, we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least $5,000. Reservation payments and deposits are used by us to fund, in part, our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand.

Marketing

Our principal marketing goals are to:

 

 	? 	
generate demand for our vehicles and drive leads to our sales teams;

 

 	? 	
build long-term brand awareness and manage corporate reputation;

 

 	? 	
manage our existing customer base to create loyalty and customer referrals; and

 

 	? 	
enable customer input into the product development process.

Historically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue to do so. To date, media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We also use traditional means of advertising including product placement in a variety of media outlets and pay-per-click advertisements on websites and applications relevant to our target demographics.

Our marketing efforts include events where our vehicles are displayed and demonstrated. These events range from widely attended public events, such as the Detroit, Los Angeles, and Frankfurt auto shows, to smaller events oriented towards sales, such as private drive events.

Service and Warranty

Service

We provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service centers, at our Service Plus locations or, in certain areas for an additional charge, through Tesla Ranger mobile technicians who provide services that do not require a vehicle lift. We own and operate over 70 service locations as of February 19, 2014. We are continuing our plan to build a number of additional service centers in several markets worldwide.

Tesla Roadster owners can upload data from their vehicle and send it to us on a memory card and Model S is designed with the capability to wirelessly upload the data to us via an on-board GSM system, allowing us to diagnose and remedy many problems before ever looking at the vehicle. When maintenance or service is required, a customer can schedule service by contacting one of our Tesla service centers. Our Tesla Rangers can also perform an array of services that do not require a vehicle lift from the convenience of a customer抯 home or other remote location.

We believe that our company-owned service centers enable our technicians to work closely with our engineers and research and development teams in Silicon Valley to identify problems, find solutions, and incorporate improvements faster than incumbent automobile manufacturers.

New Vehicle Limited Warranty, Maintenance and Extended Service Plans

For our Model S customers, we provide a four year or 50,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty with every Model S, subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty also covers the battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, depending on the size of the vehicle抯 battery, although the battery抯 charging capacity is not covered.

In addition to the New Vehicle Limited Warranty, we offer a comprehensive maintenance program for Model S, which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100,000 miles and an Extended Service Plan. The maintenance plans cover annual inspections, 24 hour roadside assistance and the replacement of wear and tear parts, excluding tires and the battery, with either a fixed fee per visit for Tesla Ranger service or unlimited Tesla Ranger visits for a higher initial purchase price. The Extended Service Plan

 

12

Table of Contents
covers the repair or replacement of Model S parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50,000 miles after the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.

For our Roadster customers, we provided a three year or 36,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty with every Tesla Roadster, which we extended to four years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. Customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service Plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover the repair or replacement of Roadster parts for up to an additional three years or 36,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. We have previously provided our Tesla Roadster customers with a battery replacement option to replace the battery in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles.

Our New Vehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service plans are subject to certain limitations, exclusions or separate warranties, including certain wear items, such as tires, brake pads, paint and general appearance, and battery performance, and are intended to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems, battery, powertrain and brake system. In addition, all plans must be purchased within a specified period of time after vehicle purchase.

Financial Services

We offer financial products through various financial institutions in the United States, Europe and Asia. In the United States and Canada, we offer customer loans through specified commercial banking partners. In connection with certain of these loans, we offer a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S and financed their vehicle. Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a pre-determined resale value. This structure allows the customer to enjoy the benefits of Model S ownership without concern for its resale value.

Manufacturing

We conduct our powertrain and vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations at the Tesla Factory, our integrated manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, and at our facility in Tilburg, Netherlands.

We manufacture Model S and certain components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards for Model S at the Tesla Factory. The Tesla Factory contains several manufacturing operations, including stamping, machining, casting, plastics, body assembly, paint operations, final vehicle assembly and end-of-line testing. In addition, we manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors, gearboxes and components both for our vehicles and for our original equipment manufacturer customers at the Tesla Factory. Several major component systems of our vehicles are purchased from suppliers; however we have a high level of vertical integration in our manufacturing processes at the Tesla Factory. We also intend to produce the Model X and our Gen III vehicle at the Tesla Factory.

We continue to ramp production at the Tesla Factory and believe that we will be able to continue to increase its production capacity through additional capital spending as well as by changing operating patterns and adding additional shifts. In 2014, we intend to create new assembly and body shop lines which we have designed to manufacture both Model S and Model X.

For our vehicles delivered into the European Union, we conduct significant vehicle assembly and testing at our facilities in Tilburg, Netherlands. This facility also serves as a pan European parts warehouse and regional customer service center.

We have recently indicated our intention to build the Tesla Gigafactory, a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material, cell, module and battery pack production in

 

13

Table of Contents
one location. While we have not identified a final site for this facility, we currently expect that it will be located in one of the following states: Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico or Texas. We currently expect the facility to be built on a lot between 500 and 1,000 acres in size, with up to approximately 10 million square feet of production space with one or two levels. At full implementation, the Tesla Gigafactory is expected to have 6,500 dedicated Tesla and production partner employees. We currently plan to commence supplying battery packs manufactured at the Tesla Gigafactory for our vehicles, including the Gen III vehicle, and stationary storage applications, in approximately three years. The Tesla Gigafactory is currently expected to attain full production capacity in 2020, which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of approximately 500,000 vehicles annually and stationary storage applications.

We believe that the Tesla Gigafactory will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs of greater than 30% on a per kWh basis by the end of the first year of volume production of Gen III. The total capital expenditures associated with the Tesla Gigafactory through 2020 are expected to be $4-5 billion, of which approximately $2 billion is expected to come from Tesla.

Supply Chain

Model S uses over 2,000 purchased parts which we source globally from over 300 suppliers, the majority of whom are currently our single source suppliers for these components. We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source.

To date, we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our suppliers. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us. For example, while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available, we have fully qualified only two cells from one supplier for these cells. Any disruption in the supply of either battery cells could temporarily disrupt production of the vehicles until such time as a different cell is fully qualified and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully retain alternative sources of supply on a timely basis. Moreover, battery cell manufacturers may not supply us at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe.

We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, nickel and copper. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. We believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements. There are always risks and uncertainties, however, with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact their availability in sufficient quantities or reasonable prices to meet our needs.

Quality Control

Our quality control efforts are divided between product quality and supplier quality, both of which are focused on designing and producing products and processes with high levels of reliability. Our product quality engineers work with our engineering team and our suppliers to help ensure that the product designs meet functional specifications and durability requirements. Our supplier quality engineers work with our suppliers to ensure that their processes and systems are capable of delivering the parts we need at the required quality level, on time, and on budget.

Customers and Selected Relationships

We currently sell our cars primarily to individual customers. We have strategic or commercial relationships with Daimler, Toyota, and Panasonic.

Daimler AG

Beginning in 2008, we commenced efforts on a powertrain development arrangement with Daimler. In May 2009, we entered into a development agreement with Daimler under which we have performed specified research and development services for the development of a battery pack and charger for Daimler抯 Smart fortwo electric drive. All development work related to the development agreement had been completed as of December 31, 2009. Through December 2011, we had sold over 2,100 battery packs and chargers for the Smart fortwo electric drive program. In the first quarter of 2010, Daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its A-Class electric vehicles to be introduced in Europe during 2011. A formal agreement for this arrangement was entered into with Daimler in May 2010. In October 2010, we completed the development of the A-Class battery pack and charger and began shipping production parts in February 2011. Through December 2011, we sold over 500 battery packs and chargers for the A-Class EV program. In the first quarter of 2010, we completed the development and sale of modular battery packs for electric delivery vans for Freightliner, an affiliate of Daimler. Freightliner plans to use these electric vans in a limited number of customer trials.

In the first half of 2012, we received two purchase orders from Daimler related to the development of a full electric powertrain for the B-Class Mercedes-Benz vehicle. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we entered into a final development agreement for the B-Class, which includes certain development milestones and related payments. We entered into an agreement for production parts for this B-Class program in July 2013. We currently expect to substantially complete our development services under this program in early 2014 and to commence production of electric powertrains and battery packs to Daimler shortly thereafter.

In addition to these agreements, Blackstar lnvestco LLC (Blackstar), an affiliate of Daimler, beneficially owned 4,867,929 shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2013.

Toyota Motor Corporation

In May 2010, we and Toyota announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles, and for us to receive Toyota抯 support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for Model S. In July 2010, we entered into an early phase agreement to develop an electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4. With an aim by Toyota to market the electric vehicle in the United States in 2012, prototypes would be made by combining the Toyota RAV4 model with a Tesla electric powertrain. We began developing and delivering prototypes to Toyota for evaluation in September 2010.

In October 2010, we entered into a contract services agreement with Toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. We completed all of the development services for the RAV4 EV in the first quarter of 2012.

Additionally, in July 2011, we entered into an agreement to supply Toyota with electric powertrain system for the RAV4 EV. We began delivery of these systems to Toyota for installation into the Toyota RAV4 EV in the first half of 2012. Our production activities under this program are expected to continue through 2014. We expect to complete shipping electric powertrains for the current RAV4 model by the end of this year.

In addition to these agreements, in July 2010, we sold 2,941,176 shares of our common stock to Toyota at our IPO price of $17.00 per share.

Panasonic

Panasonic is a supplier of battery cells for our battery packs. In January 2010, we announced that we were collaborating with Panasonic on the development of next-generation electric vehicle cells based on the 18650 form factor and nickel-based lithium ion chemistry. In October 2011, we finalized a supply agreement for these battery cells. The agreement supplies us with battery cells to build more than 80,000 vehicles over the next four years. In October 2013, we entered into an amendment to the supply agreement to, among other things, provide for the long-term preferential prices and a minimum of 1.8 billion lithium-ion battery cells that we intend to purchase from Panasonic from 2014 through 2017.

In November 2010, we sold 1,418,573 shares of our common stock to an entity affiliated with Panasonic Corporation at a price of $21.15 per share.

Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations

Full Repayment of United States Department of Energy Loans

In May 2013, we paid $451.8 million to settle all outstanding loan amounts due under a loan facility we had entered into with the Federal Financing Bank (FFB) and the United States Department of Energy (DOE), under the DOE抯 Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, as set forth in Section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (ATVM Program). We refer to the loan facility with the DOE as the DOE Loan Facility.

Under the DOE Loan Facility, the FFB had made available to us two multi-draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $465.0 million beginning on January 20, 2010. As of August 31, 2012, we had fully drawn down the aforementioned facilities. On May 22, 2013, we paid $451.8 million to fully retire our obligations under the DOE Loan Facility.

In connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we had also issued a warrant to the DOE to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. Upon the completion of our initial public offering on July 2, 2010, this preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase up to 3,090,111 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.54 per share. As a result of our repayment of all outstanding principal and interest under the DOE Loan Facility and the termination of the DOE Loan Facility in May 2013, the DOE warrant expired. Additionally, we amortized all remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the DOE Loan Facility.

California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives

In December 2009, we finalized an arrangement with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA) that resulted in an exemption from California state sales and use taxes for $320 million of manufacturing equipment. As the equipment purchased would otherwise have been subject to California state sales and use tax, we believe this incentive resulted in tax savings by us of approximately $31 million over the period starting in December 2009 and ending in December 2013. The equipment purchases were used only for three purposes: (i) to establish our production facility for Model S in California, (ii) to upgrade our Palo Alto powertrain production facility, and (iii) to expand our current Tesla Roadster assembly operations at our Menlo Park facility. In January 2012, we finalized an additional agreement with CAEATFA that will result in an exclusion from California state sales and use taxes for up to $292 million of manufacturing equipment. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state sales or use tax, we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately $24 million over the period starting in December 2011 and ending in December 2015. The equipment purchases may be used only for two purposes: (i) to develop Model X and its production capacity in California and, (ii) to further upgrade our powertrain production facilities in California. In December 2013, we exhausted all funds from the December 2009 approved exemption from California state sales and use taxes for

$320 million of manufacturing equipment. Also in December 2013, we finalized an additional agreement with CAEATFA that will result in an exclusion from California state sales and use taxes for up to $415 million of manufacturing equipment. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state sales or use tax, we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately $35 million over the period starting in December 2013 and ending in December 2016. The equipment purchases may be used only for three purposes: (i) to expand Model S manufacturing capacity in California, (ii) to expand electric vehicle powertrain production in California, and (iii) Model S future electric vehicle development.

Regulatory Credits

In connection with the production, delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles in global markets, we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits that can be sold to other manufacturers.

Under California抯 Zero-Emission Vehicle Regulations and those of states that have adopted the California standards, vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in those states during each model year are zero emission vehicles and partial zero emission vehicles. Currently, the states of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have such laws in effect. These laws provide that a manufacturer of may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, if they produce more zero emission vehicles than the minimum quantity required by those laws. Those manufacturers with a surplus of credits may sell those excess credits to other manufacturers who can then apply such credits to comply with the regulatory requirements, including making up for deficits. As a manufacturer of solely of zero emission vehicles, we have no minimum requirement, and as a result, we earn ZEV credits on each vehicle delivered and placed into service in such states. We have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the ZEV credits that we earn. Recently, California passed amendments to the ZEV mandate that would require all large volume manufacturers (those manufacturers selling 20,000 or more vehicles in California in 2018) to increase the number of zero emission vehicles sold starting in 2018. Under the new requirements, by 2025 up to 15.4% of each large volume manufacturers?fleet must be made of zero emission vehicles. All states that have adopted the California program will amend their programs to conform to the new California standards.

Additionally, under the Environmental Protection Agency抯 (EPA) national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards and similar standards adopted by the Canadian government, vehicle manufacturers are required to meet fleet-wide average carbon dioxide emissions standards for cars and trucks. Those manufacturers whose fleet wide average fails to meet such standards have a deficit in their emission profile. Those manufacturers whose fleet wide average performs better than such standards may earn credits. Manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we earn the full amount of GHG credits established by the standards on each vehicle sold. We have entered into agreements with another automobile manufacturer to sell the credits that we earn.

Under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration抯 (NHTSA) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, vehicle manufacturers are required to meet fleet-wide average fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. Those manufacturers whose fleet-wide average fails to meet such standards have a deficit in their fuel economy profile. Those manufacturers whose fleet-wide average performs better than such standards may earn credits. Manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. We have entered into agreements to sell the credits that we earn.

We have entered into contracts for the sale of regulatory credits with several automotive manufacturers. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, we earned revenue from the sale of regulatory credits of $194.4 million, $40.5 million, and $2.7 million, respectively. We earned revenue from the sale of ZEV credits specifically over the same time periods of $129.8 million, $32.4 million, and $2.7 million.

Regulation梀ehicle Safety and Testing

Our vehicles are subject to, and the Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), including all applicable United States federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS). The Model S fully complies with all FMVSSs without the need for any exemptions. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that a vehicle meets or otherwise obtain an exemption from all applicable FMVSSs, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, before the vehicle can be imported into or sold in the United States. There are numerous FMVSSs that apply to our vehicles. Examples of these requirements include:

 

 	? 	
Crash-worthiness requirements梚ncluding applicable and appropriate level of vehicle structure and occupant protection in frontal, side and interior impacts including through use of equipment such as seat belts and airbags which must satisfy applicable requirements;

 

 	? 	
Crash avoidance requirements梚ncluding appropriate steering, braking and equipment requirements, such as, headlamps, tail lamps, and other required lamps, all of which must conform to various photometric and performance requirements;

 

 	? 	
Electric vehicle requirements條imitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention, and avoidance of electric shock following specified crash tests;

 

 	? 	
Windshield defrosting and defogging梔efined zones of the windshield must be cleared within a specified timeframe; and

 

 	? 	
Rearview mirror requirements梤earward areas that must be visible to the driver via the mirrors.

Due to the limited number of Roadsters originally produced, we applied for, and were granted, exemptions from certain advanced air bag and electronic stability control requirements, which applied to Tesla Roadsters manufactured through November 7, 2011. For Model S, we have certified the vehicle as compliant with all U.S. safety standards without exemptions. Under U.S. law, we are required to certify compliance with, or obtain exemption from all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and we have done so with respect to each vehicle we have offered for sale in the United States. Based on testing, engineering analysis, and other information, we have certified that the Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from all applicable NHTSA standards in effect at the time of manufacture by affixing a certification label to each Tesla Roadster sold. Based on testing, engineering analysis and other information we have certified the Model S as complying with all applicable NHTSA standards in effect at the time of manufacture by affixing a certification label to each Model S sold.

We are also required to comply with other requirements of federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner抯 manual requirements.

Our vehicles sold in Europe are subject to European Union safety testing regulations. Many of those regulations, referred to as European Union Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA), are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. For Model S, we successfully completed full EU WVTA homologation and received approval last year by the RDW, the Dutch type approval authority. Due to reciprocity agreements in place throughout the European Union, RDW抯 type approval is valid in the entire EU. We have also sought and received type approval for non-EU European countries, including Switzerland, Iceland, and Norway. We also plan to introduce Model S vehicles in other markets such as China, Japan, and Australia. We successfully demonstrated and received type approval for delivery of 85kWh equipped Model S vehicles to China. Plans are currently underway to obtain type approval for the 60kWh equipped Model S vehicle in China and both battery pack variants for markets in Japan and Australia, including a forthcoming right-hand drive version.

The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer抯 suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, the Act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as determined by EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are conducted.

Regulation桬PA Emissions & Certificate of Conformity

The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) with respect to emissions for our vehicles, including Model S. The Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act抯 standards and both the Certificate of Conformity and the Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles.

Regulation桞attery Safety and Testing

Our battery pack conforms with mandatory regulations that govern transport of 揹angerous goods?that may present a risk in transportation, which includes lithium-ion batteries. The governing regulations, which are issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations, and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of transportation when these items are shipped such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck, or by air.

We have completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs demonstrating our compliance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, including:

 

 	? 	
Altitude simulation梥imulating air transport;

 

 	? 	
Thermal cycling梐ssessing cell and battery seal integrity;

 

 	? 	
Vibration梥imulating vibration during transport;

 

 	? 	
Shock梥imulating possible impacts during transport; and

 

 	? 	
External short circuit梥imulating an external short circuit.

We also subject our battery packs to the appropriate tests specified in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2464 and J2929 which include further tests such as immersion, humidity, and exposure to fire.

We use lithium metal oxide cells in our battery packs. The cells do not contain any lead, mercury, cadmium, or other hazardous materials, heavy metals, or any toxic materials. Our battery packs include certain packaging materials which contain trace amounts of various hazardous chemicals whose use, storage and disposal is regulated under federal law. We currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery packs. If a customer wishes to dispose of a battery pack from one of our vehicles, we anticipate accepting the depleted battery from the customer without any additional charge.

Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation

State law regulates the manufacture, distribution and sale of automobiles, and generally requires motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed. To the extent possible, we plan to secure dealer licenses (or the equivalent of a dealer license) and engage in activities as a motor vehicle dealer in so far as we are permitted to do so as we open additional Tesla stores and service centers. Some states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer. To sell vehicles to residents of states

 

19

Table of Contents
where we are not licensed as a dealer, to the extent permitted by local law, both the actual sale would generally have to occur out of state. In this scenario, it is possible that activities related to marketing, advertising, taking orders, taking reservations and reservation payments, and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state抯 motor vehicle industry laws. Regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and, in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers, may otherwise prohibit or impact our planned activities.

In jurisdictions where we do not have a Tesla store, a customer may try to purchase our vehicles over the internet. However, some states have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state in order to sell vehicles to its residents. In some states where we have opened a viewing 揼allery?that is not a full retail location, it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturer-dealer laws. Although we would prefer that a state regulator address any concerns by discussing such concerns with us and requesting voluntary compliance, a state could also take action against us, including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities. In addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities.

The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state.

Moreover, as we expand our footprint in the United States, Dealer Associations have been bringing litigation challenging the legality of our operations, as well as trying to use administrative and legislative processes to shut down our ability to expand and even threatening existing operations. Although we have prevailed in every lawsuit brought by these Dealer Associations in Massachusetts, New York and Ohio, we expect that additional challenges will be brought. In addition, Dealer Associations are actively lobbying Governors and legislators to interpret laws or enact new laws not favorable to Tesla抯 ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations.

Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time.

In addition to licensing laws, specific laws and regulations in each of the states (and their interpretation by regulators) may limit or determine how we sell, market, advertise, and otherwise solicit sales, take orders, take reservations and reservation payments, deliver, and service vehicles for consumers and engage in other activities in that state. While we have performed an analysis of laws in certain jurisdictions in which we have Tesla stores, we have not performed a complete analysis in all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there

may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices.

Competition

Competition in the automotive industry is intense and evolving. We believe the impact of new regulatory requirements for occupant safety and vehicle emissions, technological advances in powertrain and consumer electronics components, and shifting customer needs and expectations are causing the industry to evolve in the direction of electric-based vehicles. We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to:

 

 	? 	
technological innovation;

 

 	? 	
product quality and safety;

 

 	? 	
service options;

 

 	? 	
product performance;

 

 	? 	
design and styling;

 

 	? 	
brand perception;

 

 	? 	
product price; and

 

 	? 	
manufacturing efficiency.

We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology. Within the electric-based vehicle segment, there are three primary means of powertrain electrification which will differentiate various competitors in this market:

 

 	? 	
Electric Vehicles are vehicles powered completely by a single on-board energy storage system (battery pack or fuel cell) which is refueled directly from an electricity source. Both the Tesla Roadster and Model S are examples of electric vehicles.

 

 	? 	
Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles are vehicles powered by both a battery pack with an electric motor and an internal combustion engine which can be refueled both with traditional petroleum fuels for the engine and electricity for the battery pack. The internal combustion engine can either work in parallel with the electric motor to power the wheels, such as in a parallel plug-in hybrid vehicle, or be used only to recharge the battery, such as in a series plug-in hybrid vehicle like the Chevrolet Volt.

 

 	? 	
Hybrid Electric Vehicles are vehicles powered by both a battery pack with an electric motor and an internal combustion engine but which can only be refueled with traditional petroleum fuels as the battery pack is charged via regenerative braking, such as used in a hybrid electric vehicle like the Toyota Prius.

The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. Prior to the introduction of the Nissan Leaf in December 2010, no mass produced performance highway-capable electric vehicles were being sold in the United States. In Japan, Mitsubishi has been selling its electric iMiEV since April 2010. We expect additional competitors to enter the alternate fuel vehicle market within the next several years, and as they do so, we expect that we will experience significant competition. In addition, we currently face strong competition from existing automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes.

Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. In addition to the Nissan Leaf, Ford has introduced the fully electric Ford Focus, Renault has introduced the fully electric Renault Fluence, and Fiat has introduced the Fiat 500e, among others. Moreover BMW, Daimler, Lexus, Audi, Fiat, Renault, Volkswagen and Volvo are also developing electric

Table of Contents
vehicles. For example, BMW plans to introduce its i3 city car and i8 sports car in the second quarter of 2014 and Volkswagen plans to introduce its fully electric e-Golf in 2014. Several new start-ups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles, although none of these have yet come to market. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well.

In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors introduced the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery.

Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. We believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components, as well as our history of vehicle development and production, are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition; however, we have a limited history of operations.

Intellectual Property

Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2013, we had 203 issued patents and more than 280 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection.

Segment Information

We have determined that we operate as one reporting segment, which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles and electric powertrain components. For information regarding financial data by geographic areas, see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Employees

As of December 31, 2013, we had 5,859 full-time employees. None of our employees are currently represented by labor unions or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

ITEM 1A.	RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

We may be unable to sustain our current level of production and deliveries of Model S or increase production and deliveries in line with our plans, both of which could harm our business and prospects.

We began manufacturing and delivering Model S in June 2012. We have limited experience to date in high volume manufacturing of our electric vehicles as we only recently reached full production of Model S for the U.S. market and have just recently begun production of Model S for the European and Asian markets. Our ability to further ramp-up high volume Model S production will depend upon a number of factors, including our suppliers?ability to deliver quality parts to us in a timely manner, our ability to use our manufacturing processes as planned for volume production while maintaining our desired quality levels and efficiently making design changes to ensure consistently high quality. The Model S is an all new vehicle which we are producing with new employees using new equipment and therefore our production processes are still maturing. To produce a vehicle that meets our quality standards requires us to carefully analyze each step of our production plan, improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue to train our employees. Our suppliers also must produce new products in sufficient quantities and quality levels to meet our demand. Certain suppliers have experienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements, and we continue to focus on supplier capabilities and constraints. Any disruption in maintaining our production level of Model S could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

We have only recently increased our Model S delivery rates in the United States to match our current and anticipated Model S production capacity. We have limited experience in the high volume delivery of our Model S vehicles. We have gradually ramped production of Model S and we intend to continue to increase the production rate significantly over the next several quarters. Furthermore, we have only recently commenced deliveries in Europe and have not delivered Model S vehicles outside of North America and Europe in volume; thus we may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans in Asia and other right hand drive markets later this year, which may impact our ability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals. If we are unable to increase the production rate and increase our weekly delivery rate to match our production rate of Model S, ramp up deliveries in Europe and Asia and sustain a high level of weekly Model S deliveries throughout the year, this could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

In addition, for Model S we have introduced a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques, such as aluminum spot welding systems, which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry, and Model S has a number of new and unique design features, such as a 17 inch display screen, newly designed retractable exterior door handles and a panoramic roof, each of which poses unique manufacturing challenges. Model S production and

Table of Contents
deliveries will continue to require significant resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity for Model S, or cause us to miss planned production targets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Additionally, sustaining high volume production and doing so in a manner that avoids significant cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, may be difficult.

Our ability to sustain and grow volume production and deliveries for Model S is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including:

 

 	? 	
that our suppliers will be able and willing to deliver components on a timely basis and in the necessary quantities, quality and at acceptable prices to produce Model S in volume and reach our financial targets;

 

 	? 	
that we will be able to complete any necessary adjustments to the vehicle design or manufacturing processes of Model S in a timely manner that meets our production plan and allows for high quality vehicles;

 

 	? 	
that we will be able to commence and execute the launch and ramp of Model S in Asia pursuant to our current timeline;

 

 	? 	
that we will be able to adequately respond in a timely manner to any problems that may arise with our vehicles;

 

 	? 	
that we will be able to schedule and complete deliveries at our planned higher volume production levels;

 

 	? 	
that the equipment or tooling which we have purchased or which we select will be able to accurately manufacture the vehicle within specified design tolerances, and will not suffer from unexpected breakdowns or damage which could negatively affect the rate needed to produce vehicles in volume;

 

 	? 	
that we will be able to comply with environmental, workplace safety, customs and similar regulations required to operate our manufacturing facilities;

 

 	? 	
that we will be able to maintain and improve quality controls as we transition to a higher level of in-house manufacturing process; and

 

 	? 	
that the information technology systems that we are currently expanding and improving upon will be effective to manage high volume production.

Finally, detailed long-term testing of quality, reliability and durability testing of Model S, are ongoing and any negative results from such testing could cause production or delivery delays, cost increases or lower quality of our Model S vehicles.

We are dependent on our suppliers, the vast majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to continue to deliver, or their refusal to deliver, necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner at prices, quality levels, and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

Model S contains numerous purchased parts which we source globally from over 300 direct suppliers, the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers for these components. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, the majority of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from single sources. To date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we do not maintain long-term agreements with a number of our suppliers.

While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term, or at all, at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate

 

24

Table of Contents
sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be time consuming, costly and may force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle抯 design.

This supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for Model S, as well as for our powertrain component sales activities. For example, earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in Japan in March 2011 could negatively impact our supply chain. We have in the past experienced source disruptions in our supply chains, including those relating to our slower-than-anticipated ramp in our Model S production goals for 2012. We may experience additional delays in the future with respect to Model S and any other future vehicle we may produce. In addition, because we have written agreements in place with the majority, but not all of, our suppliers, this may create uncertainty regarding certain suppliers?obligations to us, including but not limited to, those regarding warranty and product liability. Changes in business conditions, wars, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers?ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we experience significantly increased demand, or need to replace certain existing suppliers, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us, at all, or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. In the past, we have replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards. The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

Changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost and delay. We have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made, and we may experience similar cost increases in the future. Additionally, we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them cheaper to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs, our operating results will suffer. Additionally, cost reduction efforts may interrupt or harm our normal production processes, thereby harming Model S quality or reducing Model S production output.

Furthermore, a failure by our suppliers to provide the components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our performance electric vehicles such as Model S could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Finally, in October 2013, we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with Panasonic Corporation in order to address our anticipated short- to medium-term lithium ion battery cell needs. While we expect that this supply agreement, as amended, will provide us with sufficient cells for the next few years, we may not be able to meet our long-term needs, including for our third generation electric vehicle, which we refer as 揋en III,?and other programs we may introduce, without securing additional suppliers or other sources for cells. If we cannot secure such additional suppliers or sources, we could experience production delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

If we are unable to adequately reduce the manufacturing costs of Model S or otherwise control the costs associated with operating our business, our financial condition and operating results will suffer.

Our production costs for Model S were high initially due to start-up costs at the Tesla Factory, manufacturing inefficiencies including low absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, higher logistics costs due to the immaturity of our supply chain, and higher initial prices for component parts during the initial period after the launch and ramp of Model S. As we have gradually ramped production of Model S, manufacturing costs per

 

25

Table of Contents
vehicle have fallen. While we expect further cost reduction efforts undertaken by both us and our suppliers will continue to reduce costs during the next several quarters, there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve planned cost reductions from our various cost savings initiatives, and the failure to achieve such savings would negatively affect our ability to reach our gross margin and profitability goals.

We incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our high-performance electric cars, assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel. We may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of Model S and powertrain manufacturing facilities and the planned launch in Asia in the spring of 2014. Furthermore, if we are unable to produce Model X pursuant to our plan due to cost overruns or other unexpected costs, we may not be able to meet our gross margin targets.

Additionally, in the future we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our vehicles, including through the use of traditional media such as television, radio and print, even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited as we have to date relied upon unconventional marketing efforts. If we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed. Furthermore, many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control. For example, the costs of our raw materials and components, such as lithium-ion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels, could increase due to shortages as global demand for these products increases. Indeed, if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology, shortages could occur which would result in increased material costs to us or potentially limit our ability to expand production.

Our long-term success will be dependent upon our ability to design, build and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models, specifically Model S and new vehicle models such as Model X and Gen III, in the U.S. and abroad.

Our long-term success is dependent on market acceptance of the Model S sedan and future electric vehicles we introduce. In the United States, there is no guarantee that Model S will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public, especially in the long-term. As we expand in Europe and enter into Asia, there is no guarantee that customers in these markets will embrace our vehicles and if they do not, demand for our vehicles could be lower than our expectations. For example, we have experienced greater initial success in selling Model S vehicles in Norway than in the rest of Europe.

Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to design future electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models, including the Model X crossover, will become commercially viable. To date, we have publicly revealed only an early prototype of the Model X. To the extent that we are not able to build Model X to the expectations created by the early prototype and our announced specifications, customers may cancel their reservations, our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose confidence in us.

In addition, we have also announced our intent to develop Gen III which we expect to produce at the Tesla Factory after the introduction of Model X. We intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our Model S. Importantly, we anticipate producing our Gen III vehicle for the mass market and thus we will need a high-volume supply of lithium-ion cells at reasonable prices. While our plan is to attempt to produce lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs for our Gen III vehicles at a new Tesla Gigafactory, our plans for such production are at a very early stage and we have not yet selected a site for the construction of the Tesla Gigafactory nor completed a factory design. In addition, we have no experience in the production of lithium-ion cells, and accordingly we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell production and to date we have not formalized such partnerships. In addition, the cost of building and operating the Tesla Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the Tesla Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate. If we are unable to build the Tesla Gigafactory in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells for Gen III at reasonable prices and thus are forced to rely on others to

 

26

Table of Contents
supply us with lithium-ion cells for Gen III, our ability to produce our Gen III vehicles at a price that allows us to sell Gen III profitably could be constrained. Finally, we have very limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple models of vehicles, such as Model S (including any variants we may introduce such as right-hand drive), Model X and Gen III. While we intend each of our production vehicles and their variants to meet a distinct segment of the automotive market, our vehicles may end up competing with each other which may delay sales and associated revenue to future periods. Also, if we fail to accurately anticipate demand for each of our vehicles, this could result in inefficient expenditures and production delays. Furthermore, historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As technologies change in the future for automobiles in general and performance electric vehicles specifically, we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology and meet customer expectations. To date, we have limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling our electric vehicles.

Our future growth is dependent upon consumers?willingness to adopt electric vehicles.

Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for, alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular. If the market for electric vehicles in the U.S., Europe and Asia does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors.

Other factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically electric vehicles, include:

 

 	? 	
perceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of electric vehicles, such as those related to the Chevrolet Volt battery pack fires or recent incidents involving Model S;

 

 	? 	
perceptions about vehicle safety in general, in particular safety issues that may be attributed to the use of advanced technology, including vehicle electronics and regenerative braking systems;

 

 	? 	
negative perceptions of electric vehicles, such as that they are more expensive than non-electric vehicles and are only affordable with government subsidies;

 

 	? 	
the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge and the effects of weather on this range;

 

 	? 	
the decline of an electric vehicle抯 range resulting from deterioration over time in the battery抯 ability to hold a charge;

 

 	? 	
varied calculations for driving ranges achievable by EVs, which is inherently difficult given numerous factors affecting battery range;

 

 	? 	
our capability to rapidly swap out the Model S battery pack and our plans to develop specialized public facilities to perform such swapping;

 

 	? 	
concerns about electric grid capacity and reliability, which could derail our past and present efforts to promote electric vehicles as a practical solution to vehicles which require gasoline;

 

 	? 	
concerns by potential customers that if their battery pack is not charged properly, it may become unusable and may need to be replaced;

 

27

Table of Contents
 	? 	
the availability of alternative fuel vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;

 

 	? 	
improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;

 

 	? 	
the availability of service for electric vehicles;

 

 	? 	
consumers?desire and ability to purchase a luxury automobile or one that is perceived as exclusive;

 

 	? 	
the environmental consciousness of consumers;

 

 	? 	
volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;

 

 	? 	
consumers?perceptions of the dependency of the United States on oil from unstable or hostile countries;

 

 	? 	
government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy as well as tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles;

 

 	? 	
access to charging stations, standardization of electric vehicle charging systems and consumers?perceptions about convenience and cost to charge an electric vehicle; and

 

 	? 	
perceptions about and the actual cost of alternative fuel.

In addition, reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles, and based on our own internal testing, we estimate that our vehicles may experience a material reduction in range when operated in extremely cold temperatures. To the extent customers have concerns about such reductions or third party reports which suggest reductions in range greater than our estimates gain widespread acceptance, our ability to market and sell our vehicles, particularly in colder climates, may be adversely impacted.

Additionally, we will become subject to regulations that require us to alter the design of our vehicles, which could negatively impact consumer interest in our vehicles. For example, our electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles. Due to concerns about quiet vehicles and vision impaired pedestrians, in January 2011, Congress passed and the President signed the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010. The new law requires NHTSA to establish minimum sounds for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles when travelling at low speeds. NHTSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2013 and plans to finalize a rule as soon as sometime in 2014 with an effective date that could be implemented by September 1, 2015. This will begin a three year phase-in schedule for establishing these minimum sounds in all electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Adding this artificial noise may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles, which would materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

If we fail to manage future growth effectively as we rapidly grow our company, especially internationally, we may not be able to produce, market, sell and service our vehicles successfully.

Any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We continue to expand our operations significantly in the U.S. as well as in Europe and Asia. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Risks that we face in undertaking this global expansion include:

 

 	? 	
finding and training new personnel, especially in new markets such as Europe and Asia;

 

 	? 	
controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;

 

 	? 	
establishing or expanding sales, service and Supercharger facilities in a timely manner;

 

 	? 	
adapting our products to meet local requirements in countries around the world; and

 

 	? 	
implementing and enhancing manufacturing, logistics and administrative infrastructure, systems and processes.

We intend to continue to hire a significant number of additional personnel, including manufacturing personnel, design personnel, engineers and service technicians for our performance electric vehicles. Because our high-performance vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines, we may not be able to hire individuals with sufficient training in performance electric vehicles, and we will need to expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future, the failure of which could seriously harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.

Our limited experience with our product offerings makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult.

We were formed in July 2003 and began delivering our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, in early 2008. We only began producing our second electric vehicle, Model S, in June 2012 and our production processes continue to mature, especially those production processes related to our Model S deliveries in Europe and our planned deliveries in Asia, such as for right-hand drive Model S. Model S became the primary contributor to our revenue starting in the fourth quarter of 2012. We intend in the longer term to derive substantial revenues from the sales of Model S, Model X, Gen III and future electric vehicles. Further, we have only produced an early prototype of the Model X crossover and have only recently started production of Model S for Asia. Our vehicle design and our engineering, manufacturing and component supply plans for Model S may continue to be adjusted.

In addition, our powertrain component sales, development services revenue and powertrain research and development compensation have been almost entirely generated under arrangements with Daimler AG (Daimler) and Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota), and there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into future agreements with these or other companies on favorable terms or manufacture and deliver powertrain components in a manner that is cost-effective to us.

Finally, it is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial position could be materially affected.

We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our stock price to decline.

We occasionally provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding the number of vehicles we hope to sell or produce in future periods and anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows. Correctly identifying the key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process. Our guidance is based in part on assumptions which include, but are not limited to, assumptions regarding:

 

 	? 	
our ability to achieve anticipated production and sales volumes and projected average sales prices for Model S in the U.S., Europe and Asia;

 

 	? 	
supplier and commodity-related costs; and

 

 	? 	
planned cost reductions.

Such guidance may not always be accurate or may vary from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions and the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors, or because of the way that applicable accounting rules require us to treat new product and service offerings that we may offer. We offer no assurance that such guidance will ultimately be accurate, and investors should treat any such guidance with appropriate caution. If we fail to meet our guidance or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance, even if such failure or revision is

seemingly insignificant, investors and analysts may lose confidence in us and the market value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.

Our vehicles make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame, and such events have raised concerns, and future events may lead to additional concerns, about the batteries used in automotive applications.

The battery pack in the Tesla Roadster and Model S makes use of lithium-ion cells. We also currently intend to make use of lithium-ion cells in battery packs that we sell to Toyota and Daimler as well as any future vehicles we may produce. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. Extremely rare incidents of laptop computers, cell phones and electric vehicle battery packs catching fire have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells.

These events have raised concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. We have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell抯 release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells. However, we have delivered only a limited number of Tesla Roadsters and Model S sedans to customers and have limited field experience with our vehicles, especially Model S. We have also only delivered a limited number of battery packs to Toyota and Daimler. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our Model S or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. We may have to recall our vehicles or participate in a recall of a vehicle that contains our battery packs, and redesign our battery packs, which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve us, could seriously harm our business.

In addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our manufacturing facility. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor抯 electric vehicle, especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to the Tesla Roadster or Model S, may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our electric vehicles. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

If our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains fail to perform as expected, or if we suffer product recalls for Model S, our ability to develop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed.

Our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains such as the Toyota RAV4 EV or the upcoming Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. For example, our vehicles use a substantial amount of software code to operate. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced, and changes to software may have unexpected effects. Model S issues experienced by customers include those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery. Although we are attempting to remedy the Model S issues experienced by our customers in a rapid manner by expanding our service centers and personnel, such efforts may not be timely or up to the satisfaction of our customers.

While we have performed extensive internal testing, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term performance of our battery packs, powertrains and vehicles. Specifically, we have only a limited amount of data by which to evaluate Model S, upon which our business prospects depend, due to the fact that we only recently began production in June 2012. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers.

We have experienced product recalls, including in May 2009, October 2010, and June 2013, all of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain. In May 2009, we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider, which is the partially assembled Tesla Roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. In June 2013, we initiated a recall of slightly more than a thousand Model S vehicles to inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process. Rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in an upright position. Failure of this component may have resulted in the collapse of the rear seat back during a crash. Although the cost of this recall was not material, and limited to a small number of total Model S抯 produced, we may experience additional recalls in the future, which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects and results of operations.

Moreover, in January 2014 we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain Universal Mobile Connector NEMA 14-50 adapters, which are part of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves, potentially overheating during charging. We further announced that we will provide upgraded NEMA 14-50 adapters to our customers as an additional safeguard. If such measures do not adequately address the underlying concerns, however, or if the public perceives such steps to be an indication of safety concerns about the vehicles, our business, prospects and results of operations could be harmed.

Our electric vehicles may not perform consistent with customers?expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available. For example, our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles, and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the market. Additionally, while Model S recently achieved an overall five star safety rating by NHTSA, such rating is not a guarantee of safe product design or that any individual vehicle will be free of any defect or failure. Any product defects or any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.

We have a history of losses and have to deliver significant cost reductions to achieve sustained, long-term profitability and long-term commercial success.

We have had net losses on a GAAP basis in each quarter since our inception, except for the first quarter of 2013. Even if we are able to successfully maintain our current Model S production levels, there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful. In order to maintain profitability as well as long-term commercial success, we must continue to achieve our planned cost reductions and control our operational costs while producing quality Model S vehicles at volume, maintain and increase our Model S delivery rates to match our current and anticipated Model S production capacity, maintain strong demand for Model S in the U.S., and grow demand for Model S abroad in Europe and Asia. Failure to do one or more of these things could prevent us from achieving sustained, long-term profitability.

The introduction of our resale value guarantee may result in lower revenues and profits and exposes us to resale risk to the extent many customers elect to return their vehicles to us and the residual values of these cars are below the guaranteed value.

We recently began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and Canada and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a pre-determined resale value. As a result of this resale value guarantee and customers having the option of selling their vehicles to us, we apply lease accounting to such purchases, which

 

31

Table of Contents
defers the recognition of the associated revenues over time instead of full recognition at vehicle delivery. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we provided the resale value guarantee to approximately 40% of Model S deliveries in the United States and we expect the penetration rate to increase with the expansion of our financing programs in additional states in the United States and in international markets. Although the resale value guarantee does not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery, a significant uptake under this program could have a significant adverse impact on our near term GAAP revenues and operating results. Furthermore, while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles?resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates, which could impact our future cash flows and/or profitability. Currently, there is only a very limited secondary market for our electric vehicles in particular, and electric vehicles in general, on which to base our estimates, and such a secondary market may not develop in the future. Our residual value and return volume estimates could prove to be incorrect, either of which could harm our financial condition and operating results.

Increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials, in particular lithium-ion cells, could harm our business.

We may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials. Any such increase or supply interruption could materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, nickel and copper. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithium-ion cells. These risks include:

 

 	? 	
the inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the numbers of lithium-ion cells required to support the growth of the electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases;

 

 	? 	
disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by battery cell manufacturers;

 

 	? 	
an increase in the cost of raw materials, such as nickel used in lithium-ion cells, or aluminum used in the body of Model S; and

 

 	? 	
fluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as our battery cell purchases are currently denominated in Japanese yen.

Our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles?battery packs as well as for the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers. While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs, we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendors could disrupt production of Model S and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or prices charged to us, such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased electric vehicle prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase Model S prices in response to increased raw material costs could be viewed negatively by our customers, result in cancellations of Model S reservations and could materially and adversely affect our brand, image, business, prospects and operating results.

Our success could be harmed by negative publicity regarding our company or our products, particularly Model S.

Occasionally, third parties evaluate or publish stories regarding our vehicles. For example, in 2013 the New York Times published a review of the Model S and our Supercharger network on a route from Washington, D.C. to Boston. Despite instructions to the contrary, the reporter did not follow all recommendations, including failing to fully recharge the vehicle at one of the two Supercharger locations along the route. As a result, the Model S failed to complete the journey under its own power and the NY Times reporter published a negative review. While there were subsequent corrections by the NY Times Public Editor regarding the reporter抯 failure to conform to all Tesla recommendations, as well as problems with 損recision and judgment,?the original story still created a negative public perception about Model S, its capabilities and the Supercharger network. Such comments can and did negatively impact sales in that region. In addition, citation to the original NY Times article has continued long after its publication. To the extent that these comments are believed by the public, this may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles, including Model S and Model X, which can materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial conditions and prospects.

Our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers, which makes evaluating our business, operating results and future prospects difficult.

Our distribution model is not common in the automobile industry today, particularly in the United States. We plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicles in company-owned Tesla stores and over the internet. This model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven, especially in the United States, and subjects us to substantial risk as it requires, in the aggregate, a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system. For example, we will not be able to utilize long-established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase our sales volume, which may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we will be competing with companies with well-established distribution channels.

We have opened Tesla stores in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific Region, many of which have been open for only a short period of time. We have relatively limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our Tesla stores. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies. Implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenges, including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities, and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges. The concept and layout of our interactive stores, which are typically located in high profile retail centers, is different than what has previously been used in automotive sales. We do not know whether our store strategy will continue to be successful. We may incur additional costs in order to improve or change our retail strategy.

Other aspects of our distribution model also differ from those used by traditional automobile manufacturers. For example, we do not anticipate that we will ever carry a significant amount of Model S inventory at our stores and customers may need to wait up to a few months from the time they place an order until the time they receive their vehicle. This type of custom manufacturing is unusual in the premium sedan market in the United States and it is unproven whether the average customer will be willing to wait this amount of time for such a vehicle. If customers do not embrace this ordering and retail experience, our business will be harmed.

We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.

We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number

 

33

Table of Contents
of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles, including Model S. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. We self-insure against the risk of product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under such a policy.

We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems. If these implementations are not successful, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed.

We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems, including implementing new internally developed systems, to assist us in the management of our business. In particular, our volume production of Model S in the U.S. and abroad necessitates continued development, maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems, which include product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. These systems support our operations and enable us to produce Model S in volume. The implementation, maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement processes, manufacturing execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes that may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service vehicles, or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations. We cannot be sure that these expanded systems or their required functionality will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, or maintained. If we do not successfully implement, improve or maintain these systems, our operations may be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed. In addition, these systems or their functionality may not operate as we expect them to, and we may be required to expend significant resources to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing these functions.

We may not realize the benefits of our Supercharger network, which could harm our business, brand and operating results.

We have only recently started to deploy Tesla Superchargers in the United States and Europe. Tesla Superchargers are a network of charging stations designed to provide fast-charge capability to owners of Model S vehicles with the Supercharging option. We intend to expand the Tesla Supercharger network throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia, but we may be unable to do so due to a number of factors, including the inability to secure, or delays in securing, suitable locations and permits, problems negotiating leases with landowners or obtaining required permits for such locations, difficulties in interfacing with the infrastructures of various utility companies and greater than expected costs and difficulties of installing, maintaining and operating the network.

We may also be unable to expand the Supercharger network as fast as we intend or as the public expects, or to place the charging stations in places our customers believe to be optimal. Furthermore, even where Superchargers exist, the increasing number of Model S vehicles may oversaturate the available charging bays at such Superchargers, leading to increased wait times and dissatisfaction for customers. In addition, as we have announced that we will not be charging our customers to access this network in addition to what they have already paid for their vehicles, any significant unexpected costs that we encounter will entirely be borne by us and may harm our operating results. Although our Supercharger network is intended to address customer concerns regarding long-distance travel, this network may not result in increased reservations or sales of Model S

Table of Contents
or future vehicles. If our Supercharger network is not expanded as currently planned or as quickly as planned, we may not realize the benefits of our Supercharger network and our business and operating results could be materially affected.

If we are unable to design, develop, market and sell new electric vehicles that address additional market opportunities, our business, prospects and operating results will suffer.

We may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicles, address new market segments or develop a significantly broader customer base. In 2012, we publicly revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. We have also announced our intent to develop Gen III based on a smaller platform than the Model S which we expect to produce at the Tesla Factory after the introduction of Model X. The Gen III is currently planned to be a lower cost, smaller sedan designed for the mass market. Therefore, we intend to the manufacture Gen III in significantly higher volumes than Model S and there can be no assurance we can successfully scale our business accordingly. In addition, we have not yet finalized the design, engineering or component sourcing plans for Gen III and there are no assurances that we will be able to bring this vehicle to market at the price point and in the volume that we currently intend, if at all. The market for vehicles in the price range we expect for Gen III is much more competitive than for Models S and X, and therefore margins are likely to be lower compared to Model S margins. Our efforts to manufacture and sell a sufficiently profitable Gen III may not be as successful, and therefore our business, prospects and operating results may suffer. Our failure to address additional market opportunities would harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

We may experience significant delays in the design, manufacture and launch of Model X which could harm our business and prospects.

We expect to have Model X prototypes with production design on the road by the end of 2014 and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015. Any significant delay in the design, manufacture and launch of Model X could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Automobile manufacturers often experience delays in the design, manufacture and commercial release of new vehicle models. We experienced significant delays in launching the Tesla Roadster, which resulted in additional costs and adverse publicity for our business. In 2012, we also experienced delays in the ramp of Model S. We may experience further delays in launching Model X which may result in cost overruns and adverse publicity. We are in the design and development stages of Model X. Furthermore, we have not yet evaluated, qualified or selected all of our suppliers for the planned production of Model X. We may not be able to engage suppliers for the components in a timely manner, at an acceptable price or in the necessary quantities. We will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that Model X is in compliance with applicable NHTSA safety regulations and obtain EPA and CARB certification to emission regulations prior to beginning volume production and delivery of the vehicles. In addition, we have limited resources and, to the extent that such engineering and manufacturing resources are devoted to Model S or are otherwise engaged such as in development services activities, we may have difficulty designing and delivering Model X in a timely manner. If we are not able to manufacture and deliver Model X in a timely manner and consistent with our production timeline, budget and cost projections, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed.

The automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry. We currently face competition from new and established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future.

The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. Other automobile manufacturers entered the electric vehicle market at the end of 2010 and we expect additional competitors to enter this market. With respect to Model S, we face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes.

Table of Contents
Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. Mitsubishi has been selling its fully electric iMiEV in Japan since April 2010 and Nissan has been selling the fully electric Nissan Leaf since December 2010. In the past few years, Ford has introduced the fully electric Ford Focus, Renault has introduced the fully electric Renault Fluence, and Fiat has introduced the Fiat 500e, among others. Moreover, BMW intends to introduce the fully electric BMW i3 in the second quarter of 2014 and Volkswagen plans to introduce its fully electric e-Golf and in 2014. In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors introduced the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery pack.

Moreover, it has been reported that many of the other large OEMs, such as Daimler, Lexus and Audi, are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also entered or announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well.

Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. Additionally, we have not in the past, and do not currently, offer customary discounts on our vehicles like most of our competitors do.

We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our cars or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile, which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating results.

Volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods. For example, according to automotive industry sources, sales of passenger vehicles in North America during the fourth quarter of 2008 were over 30% lower than those during the same period in the prior year. Demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we currently or will sell

Table of Contents
our electric vehicles, such as Europe and Asia, will impact our business, prospects and operating results as well. Demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles, such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers.

Our financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to the seasonality of our business, fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.

Our operating results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to many factors, including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles. Demand for new cars in the automobile industry typically declines over the winter season, while sales are generally higher during the spring and summer months. Sales of the Tesla Roadster fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters. We note that, in general, automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of Model S and future models may have similar seasonality. However, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. Also, any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for our vehicles. Our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue.

In addition, we expect our period-to-period operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we, among other things, design, develop and manufacture Model X and future products, increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facilities to produce vehicles at higher volumes, develop the Tesla Gigafactory, open new Tesla service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities, open new Supercharger locations, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results, especially in the short-term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.

If we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among consumers, analysts and within our industry, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and stock price may suffer materially.

Our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support. If we were to cease or cut back operations, even years from now, buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support. As a result, consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. If we are required to curtail our expansion plans in the future as we have done in the past, this may result in negative perceptions regarding our long-term business prospects and may lead to cancellations of Model S or Model X orders and reservations.

Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts and other parties in our liquidity and long-term business prospects. In contrast to some more

 

37

Table of Contents
established automakers, we believe that, in our case, the task of maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by factors such as the following:

 

 	? 	
our limited operating history;

 

 	? 	
unfamiliarity with or uncertainty about Model X;

 

 	? 	
uncertainty about the long-term marketplace acceptance of alternative fuel vehicles generally, or electric vehicles specifically;

 

 	? 	
the perceived prospect that we will need ongoing infusions of external capital to fund our planned operations;

 

 	? 	
the size of our expansion plans in comparison to our existing capital base and scope and history of operations; and

 

 	? 	
the prospect or actual emergence of direct, sustained competitive pressure from more established automakers, which may be more likely if our initial efforts are perceived to be commercially successful.

Many of these factors are largely outside our control, and any negative perceptions about our long-term business prospects, even if exaggerated or unfounded, would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds when needed.

We may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected.

The design, manufacture, sale and servicing of automobiles is a capital intensive business. We expect that our principal sources of liquidity will provide us adequate liquidity based on our current plans. However, until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows, if the costs for developing and manufacturing Model X exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses or embark on or accelerate new significant strategic investments, such as the Tesla Gigafactory, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. This capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations, continue research and development projects, including those for our planned Model X crossover and Gen III vehicle, establish sales and service centers, build and deploy Superchargers and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce Model X. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

We have limited experience servicing our vehicles and we are using a different service model from the one typically used in the industry. If we are unable to address the service requirements of our existing and future customers, our business will be materially and adversely affected.

If we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers and meet customer expectations regarding service, our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected. We have limited experience servicing our vehicles. Servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques. If we are unable to satisfactorily service our customers and the various service related issues that they are facing and may face in the future, our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional Model S vehicles could be impaired.

We service our performance electric vehicles through our company-owned Tesla service centers, certain of our stores, and through our mobile service technicians known as the Tesla Rangers. However, certain service centers have been open for short periods, and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles at these locations. We will need to open new standalone service centers and hire and train significant numbers of new

 

38

Table of Contents
employees to staff these service centers and act as Tesla Rangers, in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles. We only implemented our Tesla Rangers program in October 2009 and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers?vehicles. There can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases.

We do not expect to be able to open Tesla service centers in all the geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside. In order to address the service needs of customers who are not in geographical proximity to our service centers, we plan to either transport those vehicles to the nearest Tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile Tesla Rangers to service the vehicles at the customer抯 location. These special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers. In addition, a number of potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we do not adequately address our customers?service needs, our brand and reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.

Traditional automobile manufacturers in the United States do not provide maintenance and repair services directly. Consumers must rather service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. We do not have any such arrangements with third party service providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles. At this point, we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future. As our vehicles are placed in more locations, we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales, thereby harming our business and prospects.

In addition, the motor vehicle industry laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the state. Whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain. While we believe our Tesla Ranger program and our practice of shipping customers?vehicles to our nearest Tesla store for service would satisfy regulators in these circumstances, without seeking formal regulatory guidance, there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states. Further, certain state franchise laws which prohibit manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from providing vehicle service. If issues arise in connection with these laws, certain aspects of Tesla抯 service program would need to be restructured to comply with state law, which may harm our business.

We may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening the Tesla brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business, revenues and prospects.

Our business and prospects are heavily dependent on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand. Any failure to develop, maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the Model S, Model X, Gen III and other future planned electric vehicles, and sell our electric powertrain components. If we do not continue to establish, maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and repair services, and we have very limited experience in these areas. Any problems associated with the Toyota RAV4 EV that uses a Tesla powertrain, the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV that will use a Tesla powertrain or the Model X may hurt the Tesla brand.

Table of Contents
In addition, we expect that our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts. To date, we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet, word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand. To further promote our brand, we may be required to change our marketing practices, which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses, including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in Detroit, Japan and the European Union, have greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong brand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.

If our vehicle owners customize our vehicles or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket products, the vehicle may not operate properly, which could harm our business.

Automobile enthusiasts may seek to 揾ack?our vehicles to modify its performance which could compromise vehicle safety systems. Also, we are aware of customers who have customized their vehicles with after-market parts that may compromise driver safety. For example, some customers have installed seats that elevate the driver such that airbag and other safety systems could be compromised. Other customers have changed wheels and tires, while others have installed large speaker systems that may impact the electrical systems of the vehicle. We have not tested, nor do we endorse, such changes or products. In addition, customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets can expose our customers to injury from high voltage electricity. Such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety of our vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could result in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Our deposits for Model S and reservations for Model X may be refundable to customers, and significant cancellations could harm our financial condition and business prospects.

As of December 31, 2013, we had $163.2 million in customer deposits, primarily for Model S and Model X. Model S deposits are generally subject to cancellation by the customer and fully refundable up until two weeks after placing the order. Model X reservations are fully refundable until such time when customers begin to configure their vehicles for delivery. We have experienced order cancellations for our vehicles and have had to refund the related deposits, and cancellations may continue.

Given the lead times that we have historically experienced between customer reservation and delivery on the Tesla Roadster and on Model S and that we expect to experience on Model X, there is risk that customers who have placed orders or made reservations for our vehicles may cancel such orders or reservations and not ultimately take delivery on vehicles due to potential changes in customer preferences, competitive developments and other factors.

Additionally, if we encounter delays in our planned launch and ramp in Asia, or further delays in the introduction of Model X, a significant number of our customers could similarly cancel their orders or reservations and demand refunds of their deposits. As a result, no assurance can be made that orders and reservations will not be cancelled and will ultimately result in the final purchase, delivery, and sale of the vehicle.

Our plan to expand our network of Tesla stores, service centers and Superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles. In addition, we may not be able to open stores or service centers in certain states or Superchargers in desired locations.

of our electric vehicles. This ongoing global expansion may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we will be able to expand on the budget or timeline we have established. We will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale and service of our vehicles in those jurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. If we experience any delays in expanding our network of Tesla stores, service centers and Superchargers, this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have opened Tesla stores and service centers in major metropolitan areas throughout North America, Europe and Asia, and we plan to open additional stores and service centers worldwide to support our ongoing worldwide Model S rollout. We have also rapidly expanded our Supercharger network in the U.S .and Europe. However, we may not be able to expand at a sufficient rate and our planned expansion will require significant cash investment and management resources, as well as efficiency in the execution of establishing these locations and in hiring and training the necessary employees to effectively sell and service our vehicles.

Furthermore, certain states and foreign jurisdictions may have permit requirements, franchise dealer laws or similar laws or regulations that may preclude or restrict our ability to open stores or sell vehicles out of such states and jurisdictions. Any such prohibition or restriction may lead to decreased sales in such jurisdictions, which could harm our business, prospects and operating results. See Risk Factor 揥e may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles.?Additionally, we may face potential difficulties in finding suitable Supercharger sites in desired locations, negotiating leases or obtaining required permits for such locations.

We face risks associated with our international operations, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions and establishing ourselves in new markets, all of which could harm our business.

We face various risks associated with our international operations. We currently have international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions in Europe and Asia that are subject to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Additionally, as part of our growth strategy, we will continue to expand our sales, maintenance, repair and Supercharger services internationally, particularly in China. However, we have limited experience to date selling and servicing our vehicles internationally and such expansion requires us to make significant expenditures, including the establishment of local operating entities, hiring of local employees and establishing facilities, in advance of generating any revenue. We are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention. These risks include:

 

 	? 	
conforming our vehicles to various international regulatory and safety requirements where our vehicles are sold, or homologation;

 

 	? 	
difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations;

 

 	? 	
difficulties attracting customers in new jurisdictions;

 

 	? 	
foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the United States;

 

 	? 	
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any interest rate swap or other hedging activities we undertake;

 

 	? 	
our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the United States, Japan and European countries, which increases the risk of unauthorized, and uncompensated, use of our technology;

 

 	? 	
United States and foreign government trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls;

preferences of foreign nations for domestically produced vehicles;

 

 	? 	
changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;

 

 	? 	
political instability, natural disasters, war or events of terrorism; and

 

 	? 	
the strength of international economies.

Additionally, as we have expanded into new international markets, we have faced challenges with ensuring that our charging equipment works successfully with the charging infrastructure in such markets. For example, we have encountered such challenges in Norway. These types of issues could also arise as we enter into other new markets, such as China. If customers experience problems with the way our charging equipment works with the local charging infrastructure, or we are unable to adapt our equipment to resolve such problems, then the viability and acceptance of our vehicles in such markets could be materially and adversely affected.

If we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed.

Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar could harm our financial results.

Our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched. A portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, the euro, the Chinese yuan and the British pound. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies (especially against the Japanese yen), our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. As a result, our operating results could be adversely affected. As we dramatically increase Model S deliveries overseas during 2014 and beyond, as well as begin delivering powertrain units to Daimler, we may have greater revenues than costs denominated in other currencies, in which case a strengthening of the dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars.

Developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicles.

Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. Any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.

The unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.

Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the customer base of our electric vehicles, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular. This could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative fuel vehicles generally and performance electric vehicles specifically. For example, we

 

42

Table of Contents
currently benefit from exemptions from California state sales and use taxes for purchases of up to $707 million of manufacturing equipment from our arrangements with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state sales and use tax, we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us through December 2016. This exemption is only available for equipment that would otherwise be subject to California sales and use taxes and that would be used only for specified purposes. If we fail to meet these conditions, we would be unable to take full advantage of this tax incentive and our financial position could be harmed.

In addition, certain regulations and laws that encourage sales of electric cars through tax credits or other subsidies could be reduced, eliminated or applied in a way that creates an adverse effect against our vehicles, either currently or at any time in the future. For example, while the federal, state and foreign governments have from time to time enacted tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel cars, funding for these programs is limited and there is no guarantee that our vehicles will be eligible for tax credits or other incentives provided to alternative fuel vehicles in the future. This would put our vehicles at a competitive disadvantage. As an example at the state level, California renewed the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, a rebate program for the purchase of qualified alternative technology vehicles for 2013. Such funds, however, may run out or be limited in ways that would be adverse to purchasers of our vehicles. Subsequent purchasers could face a delay in receiving rebates since they would have to wait until the next fiscal year抯 funding became available or be unable to obtain a rebate at all. Moreover, as more and more eligible EVs are produced, California will need to find additional sources of funding for this program or implement other options for removing eligibility for vehicles based on MSRP or customer income levels. These measures would almost certainly impact us in an adverse manner by making either our vehicles or customers ineligible for rebates. As an additional example, there is considerable discussion at the federal level over tax reform. Discussions have included reducing or even eliminating the current $7,500 tax credit available to purchasers of qualified alternative fuel vehicles, including Model S.

Also, government programs have been enacted in Europe favoring the purchase of electric vehicles, including disincentives that discourage the use of gas-powered vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees, or the 25% value added tax or other purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. In the event that such government programs are reduced or eliminated, or the available benefits thereunder are exhausted earlier than anticipated, sales of electric vehicles, including our Model S, could be adversely affected.

Our relationship with Daimler is subject to various risks which could adversely affect our business and future prospects.

Our relationship with Daimler poses various risks to us, including potential loss of access to parts that Daimler is providing for Model S and potential loss of business and adverse publicity to our brand image if there are defects or other problems discovered with our electric powertrain components that Daimler has incorporated into their vehicles. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

The operation of our vehicles is different from internal combustion engine vehicles and our customers may experience difficulty operating them properly, including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking.

We have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain. In certain instances, these protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles. For example, we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most modes of vehicle operation. Our customers may become accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle. However, when the vehicle is at maximum charge, the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed by the vehicle. Accordingly, our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking. In addition, we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the

 

43

Table of Contents
powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures. In such instances, the vehicle抯 acceleration and speed will decrease. Finally, if the driver permits the battery pack to substantially deplete its charge, the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains. The vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a stop. Despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge, the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected. There can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly, especially in these situations. Any accidents resulting from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation, result in adverse publicity and product liability claims, and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if consumers dislike these features, they may choose not to buy additional cars from us, which could also harm our business and prospects.

If we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position.

We may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and, as a result, may suffer a decline in our competitive position. Any failure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in our competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in electric vehicle technology. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, our vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles. For example, we do not manufacture battery cells, which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs.

If we are unable to attract and/or retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical, vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed and our stock price may decline.

The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services, and negatively impact our business, prospects and operating results as well as cause our stock price to decline. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and JB Straubel, our Chief Technical Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in retaining members of our senior management team as well as technical, vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive experience. In addition, we do not have 搆ey person?life insurance policies covering any of our officers or other key employees.

Currently in Northern California, there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, software engineers, manufacturing engineers and other skilled employees and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones. Our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain employees. Additionally, we compete with many mature and prosperous companies in Northern California that have far greater financial resources than we do and thus can offer current or perspective employees more lucrative incentive packages than we can. Any difficulties in retaining current employees or recruiting new ones would have an adverse effect on our performance.

We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.

We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect, Chairman of our Board of Directors and largest stockholder. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies, a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, and Chairman of SolarCity, a solar equipment installation company.

We are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities.

As an automobile manufacturer, we and our operations, both in the United States and abroad, are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials. Environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws which may require us to change our operations, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury and fines and penalties. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations.

Contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by us, as well as at properties we will own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We may face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and negatively impact our ability to operate these facilities, which would adversely impact our business prospects and operating results.

New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI) has previously identified environmental conditions at the Tesla Factory which could affect soil and groundwater, and has undertaken efforts to address these conditions. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has documented and managed the environmental issues at the Fremont site, we cannot currently determine with certainty the total potential costs to remediate pre-existing contamination, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of any environmental contamination at the Fremont site.

As the owner of the Fremont site, we may be responsible under federal and state laws and regulations for the entire investigation and remediation of any environmental contamination at the Fremont site, whether it occurred before or after the date we purchased the property. We have reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the closing of the purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions (Remediation Activities), and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such Remediation Activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement, subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing.

 

45

Table of Contents
On the ten-year anniversary of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has been spent on Remediation Activities, whichever comes first, NUMMI抯 liability to us with respect to Remediation Activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the Fremont site. At that point in time, we have agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability, including attorney fees, or any costs or penalties it may incur arising out of or in connection with any claim relating to environmental conditions and we have released NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for NUMMI抯 obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement. As of December 31, 2013, we have accrued $5.5 million related to these environmental liabilities.

There are no assurances that NUMMI will perform its obligations under our agreement and NUMMI抯 failure to perform would require us to undertake these obligations at a potentially significant cost and risk to our ability to increase the production capacity of, and operate, our Tesla Factory. Any Remediation Activities or other environmental conditions at the Fremont site could harm our operations and the future use and value of the Fremont site and could delay our production plans for Model S.

Our business may be adversely affected by union activities.

Although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Our employees may join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. Our automobile production facility in Fremont, California was purchased from NUMMI. Prior employees of NUMMI were union members and our future work force at this facility may be inclined to vote in favor of forming a labor union. We are also directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicles and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. The mere fact that our labor force could be unionized may harm our reputation in the eyes of some investors and thereby negatively affect our stock price. Consequently, the unionization of our labor force could negatively impact the company抯 health.

We are subject to substantial regulation, which is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.

Our performance electric vehicles, the sale of motor vehicles in general and the electronic components used in our vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state, and local laws. We have incurred, and expect to incur in the future, significant costs in complying with these regulations.

Regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations, such as in the United States:

 

 	? 	
the imposition of a carbon tax or the introduction of a cap-and-trade system on electric utilities could increase the cost of electricity;

 

 	? 	
increasingly stringent Clean Air Act emission regulations affecting power plants used to generate electricity could increase the cost of electricity;

 

 	? 	
changes to the regulations governing the assembly and transportation of lithium-ion battery packs, such as the UN Recommendations of the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations or regulations adopted by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) could increase the cost of lithium-ion battery packs or restrict their transport;

 

 	? 	
the amendment or rescission of the federal law and regulations mandating increased fuel economy in the United States, referred to as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development activities;

 

46

Table of Contents
 	? 	
the amendment or rescission of federal greenhouse gas tailpipe emission regulations administered by EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development activities;

 

 	? 	
the amendment or rescission of California抯 zero emission vehicle regulations administered by the California Air Resources Board under the California Health & Safety Code could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development activities, as well as our ability to monetize ZEV credits not only in California, but also in the eleven additional states that have adopted the California program;

 

 	? 	
increased sensitivity by regulators to the needs of established automobile manufacturers with large employment bases, high fixed costs and business models based on the internal combustion engine could lead them to pass regulations that could reduce the compliance costs of such established manufacturers or mitigate the effects of government efforts to promote alternative fuel vehicles; and

 

 	? 	
changes to regulations governing the export of our products could increase our costs incurred to deliver products outside the United States or force us to charge a higher price for our vehicles in such jurisdictions.

In addition, as the automotive industry moves towards greater use of electronics for vehicle systems, NHTSA and other regulatory bodies may in the future increase regulation for these electronic systems as concerns about distracted driving increase. Such concerns could affect electronic systems in Model S, including those used with the 17 inch display screen in Model S, which could reduce the appeal of Model S or require adjustments to the display screen抯 functionality.

As we are currently delivering vehicles in Europe and as we begin to deliver vehicles in Asia, we also become subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to the import, sale and service of automobiles in those regions, with which we have little or no experience complying.

To the extent the laws change, some or all of our vehicles may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.

We retain certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws.

We use our vehicles?electronic systems to log information about each vehicle抯 condition, performance and use in order to aid us in providing customer service, including vehicle diagnostics, repair and maintenance, as well as to help us collect data regarding our customers?charge time, battery usage, mileage and efficiency habits and to improve our vehicles. We also collect information about our customers through our website, at our stores and facilities, and via telephone. Our customers may object to the processing of this data, which may negatively impact our ability to provide effective customer service and develop new vehicles and products. Collection and use of our customers?personal information in conducting our business may be subject to federal and/or state laws and regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions including, in particular, various jurisdictions in Europe, and such laws and regulations may restrict our processing of such personal information and hinder our ability to attract new customers or market to existing customers. We may incur significant expenses to comply with privacy, consumer protection and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. Although we take steps to protect the security of our customers?personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers?personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could

Table of Contents
have serious negative consequences for our businesses and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles, and harm to our reputation and brand.

We may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions, which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance.

Any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We previously experienced product recalls in May 2009, October 2010 and June 2013, none of which was related to our electric powertrain. In April 2009, we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. In June 2013, we initiated a recall of slightly more than one thousand Model S vehicles to inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process. Rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in an upright position. Failure of this component may have resulted in collapse of the rear seat back during a crash. Finally, in January 2014, we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain Universal Mobile Connector NEMA 14-50 adapters, which are part of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves, potentially overheating during charging. In the future, we may at various times, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our vehicles, including Model S, or our electric powertrain components prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. For example, in November 2013 NHTSA initiated a preliminary evaluation with respect to two recent incidents in which Model S vehicles collided with road debris at highway speeds. Although we believe that NHTSA should close the preliminary evaluation without a finding of defect, it is possible that NHTSA could find that there is a defect and order Model S to be recalled. Such recalls, voluntary or involuntary, involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance.

If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We provide a three year or 36,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty with every Tesla Roadster, which we extended to four years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase Extended Service plans for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty for the Tesla Roadster to cover additional services for up to an additional three years or 36,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. Subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery, we provide a four year or 50,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty for the purchasers of Model S. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Model S covers the battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, depending on the size of the vehicle抯 battery, although the battery抯 charging capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or any Extended Service plan. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Model S to cover additional services for an additional four years or 50,000 miles, provided it is purchased within a specified period of time. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty and Extended Service plans for the Tesla Roadster and Model S are subject to certain limitations, exclusions or separate warranties, including certain wear items, such as tires, brake pads, paint and general appearance, and battery performance, and is intended to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems, powertrain and brake system. We have previously provided our Tesla Roadster customers with a battery replacement option to replace the battery in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles.

Table of Contents
We record and adjust warranty reserves based on changes in estimated costs and actual warranty costs. For new vehicles in particular, we record warranty reserves based on management抯 best estimate of projected warranty experience until adequate historical data is accumulated over a period of time, generally a few quarters. As we have limited operating experience with Model S, and therefore little experience with warranty claims for this vehicle, reserves that we recorded for Model S may be insufficient to cover all future warranty claims. Additionally, in 2013, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the customer ownership experience, we expanded the battery pack warranty and also eliminated the annual service requirement that was needed to keep the New Vehicle Limited Warranty in effect. Should this change in warranty coverage lead to an increase in warranty claims, we may need to record additional warranty reserves which would negatively affect our profitability.

Since we began initiating sales of our vehicles, we have continued to refine our warranty reserves based on our actual warranty claim experience and we may be required to undertake further changes in the future. As of December 31, 2013, we had warranty reserves of $53.2 million, and such reserve amount will increase significantly in the future as our product offerings and sales grow. We could in the future become subject to a significant and unexpected warranty expense. There can be no assurances that our currently existing or future warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims due to potential higher average warranty expenses over the product life cycle or that our limited experience with warranty claims will adequately address the needs of our customers to their satisfaction.

Unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles?systems may cause them to operate improperly or not at all, or compromise their safety and data security, which could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business.

There have been reports of vehicles of other automobile manufacturers being 揾acked?to grant access and operation of the vehicles to unauthorized persons and would-be thieves. Our vehicles, and in particular Model S, are technologically advanced machines requiring the interoperation of numerous complex and evolving hardware and software systems. Subject to our customers?ability to opt out pursuant to our privacy policy, Model S is designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality of these systems. Although we have designed, implemented and tested security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our vehicles and their systems, our information technology networks and communications with our vehicles may be vulnerable to interception, manipulation, damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors by personnel who have access to our networks and systems. Any such attacks or breaches could result in unexpected changes to our vehicles?functionality, user interface and performance characteristics. Hackers may also use similar means to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle, such as its current geographical position, previous and stored destination address history and web browser 揻avorites.?Any such unauthorized control of vehicles or access to or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and negative publicity, which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

The range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time, and this may negatively influence potential customers?decisions whether to purchase our vehicles.

The range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns as well as other factors. How a customer uses their Tesla vehicle, the frequency of recharging the battery pack at a low state of charge and the means of charging can result in additional deterioration of the battery pack抯 ability to hold a charge over the long term. For example, we currently expect that our battery pack for the Tesla Roadster will retain approximately 70% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle抯 initial range and power. Deterioration of the Model S battery pack is expected to be less than the Roadster, however, such battery pack deterioration and the related decrease in range and power over time as well as any perceived deterioration or fluctuation in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles, which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles.

We may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles.

We sell our vehicles from our Tesla stores as well as over the internet. We may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the United States as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to impose other limitations on this sales model, including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state. In certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses, we have worked with state regulators to open galleries, which are locations where potential customers can view our vehicles but are not full retail locations. It is possible that a state regulator could later determine that the activities at our gallery constitute unlicensed sales of motor vehicles.

In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws and is being determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and largely untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, the manner in which the applicable authorities are applying their state laws to our distribution model continues to be difficult to predict. Laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so.

In addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. For example, in October 2012, vehicle dealer associations in New York and Massachusetts filed lawsuits to revoke the dealer license issued to Tesla Motors New York in New York and to limit the business activity of Tesla Motors MA, Inc. in Massachusetts. These lawsuits have been dismissed, reinforcing our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. A similar litigation was recently filed in the state of Ohio. Possible additional challenges in other states, if successful, could restrict or prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states. In some states, there have also been legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model.

We are also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in Canada, Australia, and Japan, and have obtained licenses to sell vehicles in other places such as Hong Kong and China. Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time.

Regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles.

We may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs.

Companies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive inquiries from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary rights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such

 

50

Table of Contents
rights or otherwise assert their rights and seek licenses. In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party抯 intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following:

 

 	? 	
cease selling, incorporating or using vehicles or offering goods or services that incorporate or use the challenged intellectual property;

 

 	? 	
pay substantial damages;

 

 	? 	
obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or

 

 	? 	
redesign our vehicles or other goods or services.

In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other intellectual property right, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.

We may also face claims that our use of technology licensed or otherwise obtained from a third party infringes the rights of others. In such cases, we may seek indemnification from our licensors/suppliers under our contracts with them. However, indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses, depending on our use of the technology, whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation, and other factors.

Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.

Any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in weakening or loss of such rights, which may allow our competitors to offer similar or identical products or use identical or confusingly similar branding, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage, a decrease in our revenue and an attribution of potentially lower quality products to us, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright protection, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

The protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities. However, such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:

 

 	? 	
our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents;

 

 	? 	
our patents, if issued, may not be broad enough to protect our commercial endeavors;

 

 	? 	
the patents we have been granted may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented because of the pre-existence of similar patented or unpatented technology or for other reasons;

 

 	? 	
the costs associated with obtaining and enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable;

 

 	? 	
current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our intellectual property; and

 

 	? 	
our in-licensed patents may be invalidated or the holders of these patents may seek to terminate or modify our license arrangements.

Existing trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the

 

51

Table of Contents
laws of the United States, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. Unauthorized use or infringement of our trademarks in countries which have a 揻irst-to-file?system could affect our ability to successfully grow our business internationally.

Our patent applications may not result in issued patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.

The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of patented claims is uncertain. We cannot be certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions, nor can we be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford sufficient protection against a competitor with similar technology. In addition, patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws, rules and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued U.S. patents will result in issued patents in those foreign jurisdictions. Furthermore, even if these patent applications do result in issued patents, some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the United States. In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Our trademark applications in certain countries remain subject to outstanding opposition proceedings.

We currently sell and market our products and services in various countries under our Tesla marks. We have filed trademark applications for our Tesla marks and opposition proceedings to trademark applications of third parties in various countries in which we currently sell and plan to sell our products and services. Certain of our trademark applications are subject to outstanding opposition proceedings brought by owners or applicants alleging prior use of similar marks. If we cannot resolve these oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in these countries, our ability to challenge third party users of the Tesla marks will be reduced and the value of the marks representing our exclusive brand name in these countries will be diluted. In addition, there is a risk that the prior rights owners could in the future take actions to challenge our use of the Tesla marks in these countries. Such actions could have a severe impact on our position in these countries and may inhibit our ability to use the Tesla marks in these countries. If we were prevented from using the Tesla marks in any or all of these countries, we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets.

Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or unpredictable events.

Our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto and Tesla Factory in Fremont are located in Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, pandemics or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition, our lease for our Palo Alto facility permits the landlord to terminate the lease following a casualty event if the needed repairs are in excess of certain thresholds and we do not agree to pay for any uninsured amounts. We may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.

If our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity.

Our core values, which include developing the highest quality electric vehicles while operating with integrity, are an important component of our brand image, which makes our reputation particularly sensitive to

 

52

Table of Contents
allegations of unethical business practices. We do not control our independent suppliers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical business practices, such as environmental responsibility, fair wage practices, appropriate sourcing of raw materials, and compliance with child labor laws, among others. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations.

Violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier抯 labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand. This could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicles if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract negative publicity. If we, or other manufacturers in our industry, encounter similar problems in the future, it could harm our brand image, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

We are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.

We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Complying with Section 404 requires a rigorous compliance program as well as adequate time and resources. As a result of developing, improving and expanding our core information technology systems as well as implementing new systems to support our sales, engineering, supply chain and manufacturing activities, all of which require significant management time and support, we may not be able to complete our internal control evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. Additionally, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. For example, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2012 because a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to the presentation and disclosure of non-cash capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

Servicing our convertible senior notes requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.

We incurred $660.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior indebtedness in May 2013 when we issued pursuant to registered public offerings 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the Notes). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, make payments upon conversion or to refinance the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Notes or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the Notes or future indebtedness.

Table of Contents
Pursuant to their terms, holders may convert their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2018 only under certain circumstances. For example, holders may convert their Notes at their option during any quarter commencing after the third quarter of 2013 (and only during such quarter) if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for such series of notes on each applicable trading day. This condition was met in the third quarter of 2013, and consequently the Notes were convertible by their holders during the fourth quarter of 2013. However, the sales price condition was not met in the fourth quarter of 2013 and, therefore, the Notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014 but may be convertible in future periods. Should such sales price condition be met in any future quarter, the Notes will again be convertible by their holders during the immediately following quarter. Upon conversion of the Notes, we will be obligated to make cash payments in respect of the principal amounts thereof, and we may also have to deliver cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock, in respect of such Notes. Any conversion of the Notes prior to their maturity, or acceleration of the repayment of the Notes or future indebtedness after any applicable notice or grace periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, if the Notes become convertible we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material adverse impact on our reported financial results.

In addition, holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of Notes surrendered therefor or Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to purchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to purchase Notes at a time when the purchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.

We may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions, which would intensify the risks discussed above.

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, or the indenture, from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due.

The classification of our Notes may have a material effect on our reported financial results.

Holders may convert their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2018 only under certain circumstances. For example, holders may convert their Notes at their option during any quarter commencing after the third quarter of 2013 (and only during such quarter) if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the Notes on each trading day. This condition was met in the third quarter of 2013, and consequently the Notes were convertible by their holders during the fourth quarter of 2013. However, the sales price condition was not met in the fourth quarter of 2013 and, therefore, the Notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014 but may be convertible in future periods. If the Notes become convertible prior to March 1, 2018, we would be required to reclassify our Notes and the related debt issuance costs as current liabilities and certain portions of our equity outside of equity to

mezzanine equity, which would have an adverse impact on our reported financial results for such quarter, and could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.

Risks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock

Concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.

As of December 31, 2013, our executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 28.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In particular, Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman of our Board of Directors, beneficially owned approximately 27.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2013. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.

The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.

Our shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 29, 2010 and, therefore, the trading history for our common stock has been limited. In addition, the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced an intra-day trading high of $259.20 per share and a low of $33.80 per share over the last 52 weeks.

In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies?stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock during the period following a securities offering. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company抯 securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. For example, a shareholder litigation like this has recently been instituted against us. While we do not believe that it has merit, this litigation or others like it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management抯 attention and resources.

A substantial portion of our total outstanding shares are held by a small number of insiders and investors and may be sold in the near future. The large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock.

The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock. Stockholders owning a substantial portion of our total outstanding shares are entitled, under contracts providing for registration rights, to require us to register shares of our common stock owned by them for public sale in the United States, subject to the restrictions of Rule 144. In addition, we have registered shares previously issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans and agreements, a portion of which are related to outstanding option awards. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and, in certain cases, lock-up agreements, the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market. Sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult to sell shares of our common stock.

Conversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.

The conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the Notes. As described in the Risk Factor 揝ervicing our convertible senior notes requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt,?the Notes were convertible by their holders during the fourth quarter of 2013, and while they are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014, they may again become convertible in future periods if a condition to conversion for the Notes is met. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.

The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of Notes may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.

In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlay the Notes. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the Notes. We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates.

In addition, the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes). This activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes.

We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes or the shares of our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the hedge counterparties have engaged or will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

Mr. Musk borrowed funds from affiliates of certain underwriters in our public offerings and/or private placements in 2011 and 2013 and has pledged shares of our common stock to secure these borrowings. The forced sale of these shares pursuant to a margin call could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our business.

Beginning in June 2011, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co., has made extensions of credit in the aggregate amount of $275 million to Elon Musk and the Elon Musk Revocable Trust dated July 22, 2003, or the Trust, a portion of which Mr. Musk used to purchase shares of common stock in our public offering in May 2013 and private placements in June 2011 and June 2013. Interest on the loan accrues at market rates. Goldman Sachs Bank USA received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with these loans. As a regulated entity, Goldman Sachs Bank USA makes decisions regarding making and managing its loans independent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. Mr. Musk and Goldman have a long-standing relationship of almost a decade. In addition, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, has made a loan to Mr. Musk in the aggregate amount of $25 million. Interest on this loan accrues at market rates. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with this loan.

We are not a party to these loans, which are full recourse against Mr. Musk and the Trust and are secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk and the Trust and other shares of capital stock of unrelated entities owned by Mr. Musk and the Trust. The terms of these loans were negotiated directly between Mr. Musk and Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.

If the price of our common stock declines, Mr. Musk may be forced by Goldman Sachs Bank USA and/or Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of Tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans. The loans between Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC on the one hand, and Mr. Musk and the Trust on the other hand, prohibit the non-pledged shares currently owned by Mr. Musk and the Trust from being pledged to secure any other loans. These factors may limit Mr. Musk抯 ability to either pledge additional shares of Tesla common stock or sell shares of Tesla common stock as a means to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged Tesla common stock in the event of a decline in our stock price that is large enough to trigger a margin call. Any sales of common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied may cause the price of our common stock to decline further.

Anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the provisions of Delaware law, and the terms of our convertible notes could impair a takeover attempt.

Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, Delaware law and the terms of our Notes contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:

 

 	? 	
creating a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;

 

 	? 	
authorizing 揵lank check?preferred stock, which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;

 

 	? 	
limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;

 

 	? 	
limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;

 

 	? 	
requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;

 

 	? 	
controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings; and

 

 	? 	
providing the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings.

These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.

As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.

Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.

In addition, the terms of the convertible notes require us to repurchase the convertible notes in the event of a fundamental change. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the convertible notes to require us to repurchase the convertible notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders or investors in the convertible notes.

The fundamental change repurchase feature of the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.

The terms of the Notes require us to repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the Notes to require us to repurchase the Notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders or investors in the Notes.

If securities or industry analysts publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely or cease to publish research or reports about us, our stock price and trading volume could decline.

The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.

We do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.

We do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.

Information in this 2013 Form 10-K relating to our relative position in the global automotive industry is based upon the good faith estimates of management and includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture. Market share information in this 2013 Form 10-K is based on retail vehicle sales volume. Retail vehicle sales data, which represents estimated sales to the end customer, including fleets, does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during the period. However, retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles. Worldwide market share and vehicle sales data excludes the markets of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.

Retail sales volume includes vehicles produced by certain joint ventures. The joint venture agreements with SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., Ltd. (SGMW) and FAW-GM Light Duty Commercial Vehicle Co., Ltd. (FAW-GM) allow for significant rights as a member as well as the contractual right to report SGMW and FAW-GM joint venture sales in China.

The global automotive industry is highly competitive. The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include price, quality, available options, style, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.

Our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2013 reflect continued recovery in the U.S. despite an intense competitive environment. Growth was largely attributed to new portfolio entries. Our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2012 reflect an intensified competitive environment in the U.S., including aggressive competitor pricing and media spending, as well as key competitor new product launches. Our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2011 reflect the moderate improvement in certain facets of the U.S. economy which contributed to a slow but steady improvement in U.S. industry vehicle sales, as well as increased volumes in Russia and China.

Fleet Sales and Deliveries

The sales and market share data provided previously includes both retail and fleet vehicle sales. Certain fleet transactions, particularly daily rental, are generally less profitable than retail sales. A significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as operating leases under U.S. GAAP with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations. The following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales. Fleet sales data may include rounding differences (vehicles in thousands):

Product Pricing

Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products. In 2014 we will continue to price vehicles competitively, including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required. We believe this strategy, coupled with sound inventory management, will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices.

Cyclical Nature of Business

Retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries. The market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending.

Relationship with Dealers

We market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets.

The following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships:

We and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by GM Financial, Ally Financial, Inc. (Ally Financial) and other financial institutions.

The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters.

Research, Product Development and Intellectual Property

Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering, and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control, improved fuel economy and the safety of drivers and passengers. In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 research and development expenses were $7.2 billion, $7.4 billion and $8.1 billion.

Our top priority for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy because energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business strategy. Our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption.

Fuel Efficiency

We are fully committed to improving fuel efficiency and meeting regulatory standards through a combination of strategies including: (1) extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains; (2) increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions; and (3) vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter, front-wheel drive architectures.

Alternative Fuel Vehicles

Alternative fuels offer the greatest near-term potential to reduce liquid petroleum consumption in the transportation sector. Leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop FlexFuel vehicles that can run on gasoline-ethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

We currently offer 16 FlexFuel vehicles in the U.S. for the 2014 model year plus an additional four models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two. We continue to study the future role FlexFuel vehicles may play in the U.S. in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development of the refueling infrastructure. In 2013 94% of vehicle sales in Brazil were FlexFuel vehicles capable of running on 100% ethanol blends. We also market FlexFuel vehicles in Australia, Thailand and other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace.

We support the development of biodiesel blend fuels, which are clean-burning alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources, and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels.

We produce CNG bi-fuel capable vehicles in Europe such as the Opel Zafira, and in the U.S., the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana fullsize vans are offered to fleet and commercial customers, that are capable of switching between gasoline or diesel and CNG. We also produce the CNG bi-fuel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2500 HD pick-up trucks that are available to both commercial and retail customers. In addition we recently announced the offering of a CNG bi-fuel Chevrolet Impala full-size sedan to both fleet and retail markets starting in the summer of 2014. We offer LPG capable vehicles globally in select markets reflecting the infrastructure, regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold.

Hybrid, Plug-In, Extended Range and Battery Electric Vehicles

We are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eAssist, plug-in hybrid, extended range and battery electric vehicles. We currently offer 7 models in the U.S. featuring some form of electrification and continue to develop plug-in hybrid electric vehicle technology (PHEV) and extended range electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt, Opel Ampera and Cadillac ELR. In 2013 we introduced the Chevrolet Spark EV and plan to invest heavily to support the expansion of our electric vehicle offerings and in-house development and manufacturing capabilities of advanced batteries, electric motors and power control systems.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology

As part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology. Our Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs, such as Project Driveway, have accumulated nearly 3 million miles of real-world driving by consumers, celebrities, business partners and government agencies. These programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of this technology.

GM and Honda entered into a long-term agreement to co-develop a next-generation fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies, aiming for the 2020 timeframe. The collaboration expects to succeed by sharing expertise, economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and builds upon GM's and Honda抯 strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology.
 
OnStar

OnStar, LLC (OnStar) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM serving more than 6.5 million subscribers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and, through a joint venture, China. OnStar is a provider of connected safety, security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on the majority of our 2014 model year vehicles. OnStar's key services include automatic crash response, stolen vehicle assistance, remote door unlock, turn-by-turn navigation, vehicle diagnostics and hands-free calling.

OnStar has developed a system based on the findings of a Center for Disease Control and Prevention expert panel which allows OnStar advisors to alert first responders when a vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants. OnStar also launched a mobile application to provide subscribers with up-to-date vehicle information such as oil level, tire pressure and fuel level as well as providing remote start, remote door unlock and navigation services from a mobile phone.

Product Development

Our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization. This strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development. We define a global architecture as a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces.

A centralized organization is responsible for many of the non-visible parts of the vehicle such as steering, suspension, the brake system, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system. This team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world, who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand, such as exterior and interior design, tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements.

Intellectual Property

We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While none of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole, these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development. We hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.

Raw Materials, Services and Supplies

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products. The raw materials are primarily composed of steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and platinum group metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements.

In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity. Purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10% to 11% of our total purchases from 2011 to 2013.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters

Automotive Emissions Control

We are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions, including vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Advanced OBD systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems. Problems detected by the OBD system may increase warranty costs and the chance for recall. Emission and OBD requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must

meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required and will continue to become even more stringent throughout the world.

North America

The U.S. federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments. Canada抯 federal government is aligned with the U.S. federal requirements. These requirements include vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and OBD system requirements. Each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada and from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements. Fleet-wide emissions compliance must also be achieved based on a sales-weighted fleet average.

While we believe all our products are currently in compliance with EPA and CARB regulatory requirements, both agencies have ongoing 搃n-use?evaluations of compliance for products from all manufacturers. It is possible that we or either agency could identify potential non-compliance, which could lead to some type of field action to remedy the issue. Testing is conducted at various times. This includes pre-production testing of vehicles as part of certification and in-use testing of customer vehicles at specified mileages.

CARB has adopted its next round of emission requirements which phase in with the 2015 model year. These requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards. The EPA has proposed similar requirements which if adopted are expected to phase in with the 2017 model year. These new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance.

California law requires that 12% of 2014 model year cars and certain light-duty trucks sold in the state must be zero emission vehicles (ZEV) such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The requirement is based on a complex system of credits that vary in magnitude by vehicle type and model year. Manufacturers have the option of meeting a portion of this requirement with partial ZEV credit for vehicles that meet very stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards and have extended emission system warranties. Additional portions of the ZEV requirement can be met with vehicles that meet these partial ZEV requirements and incorporate advanced technology such as hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric propulsion systems meeting specified criteria. We are complying with the ZEV requirements using a variety of means including producing vehicles certified to the ZEV and partial ZEV requirements. CARB has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of ZEVs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the state's long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals. A portion of this requirement may be met with PHEVs that meet specified criteria including an extended emission system warranty.

The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the California car and light-duty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements. Thirteen states as well as the Province of Quebec currently have these standards in effect, and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the ZEV requirements. Additional states could also adopt the California standards in the future.

Vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines are also subject to stringent emission requirements. We also certify heavy-duty engines for installation in other manufacturers' products. We are using a system of credits to help meet these stringent standards as permitted by EPA and CARB regulations. We are meeting OBD requirements for heavy-duty vehicles with certain hardware and software changes.

In Mexico we must obtain model year certification from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency for each engine family and vehicle line before we can sell vehicles. Stringent light-duty vehicle emission requirements applicable to vehicles sold in Mexico are enforced starting 18 months after nationwide availability of Ultra Low Sulfur Fuels. Emission requirements applicable to medium- and heavy-duty trucks powered by gasoline, CNG or LPG were upgraded in 2012. Stringent emission requirements applicable to medium- and heavy-duty trucks powered by diesel have been proposed but no enforcement date has been established yet.

Regulations to control the emissions of greenhouse gases are discussed under 揂utomotive Fuel Economy?since we believe these regulations are effectively a form of a fuel economy requirement.

Emissions are regulated by two different entities: the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The EC imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 28 European Union (EU) Member States and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the UNECE. We must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements in witness tests and type approval from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the EU Member States. Type approval requires the manufacturer to provide a representative vehicle to the evaluating agency who then determines if the particular type of vehicle is fully compliant with the applicable regulations. The regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer in-use surveillance program. EU and UNECE requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation.

A new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and light-duty trucks, Euro 5, was effective in 2011. Future European emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles. The Euro 6 emission levels will become effective in 2017. The new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines, which currently cost more than gasoline engines. To comply with Euro 6 standards we expect that we will need to implement technologies identical to those being developed to meet U.S. emission standards. These technologies will put additional cost pressures on the already challenging European market for small- and mid-size diesel vehicles. Gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements. The measures for gasoline vehicles that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions will have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy.

In the long-term, notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in Europe, the EC will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle, real driving emission, low temperature testing, fuel evaporation and OBD.

International Operations

China has implemented Euro 4 standards with European OBD requirements nationwide for newly registered vehicles. Beijing currently requires many elements of Euro 5 standards for newly registered vehicles. Beijing, Shanghai and the Pearl River delta area are expected to require additional elements of Euro 5 standards in 2014. Nationwide implementation of Euro 5 is expected between 2015 and 2017. Beijing is considering the implementation of Euro 6 or EPA standards as early as 2016 and Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery as early as 2017. For diesel-powered vehicles China has implemented Euro 4 standards for new type approvals of both light-duty diesel vehicles and all new registrations of heavy-duty diesel vehicles. Enforcement of Euro 4 standards for new diesel light-duty registrations began in 2013.

South Korea has implemented the Euro 5 emission standards with European OBD requirements for diesel-powered vehicles and the CARB standards for gasoline/LPG-powered vehicles. Commencing in 2014 new type-approvals will require the vehicle to meet Euro 6 diesel standards. The government is also considering the introduction of amendments to the low-emission vehicle program, LEVIII of the CARB standards, for gasoline/LPG-powered vehicles with the planned implementation in 2016.

India has implemented Euro 4 equivalent emission norms in 13 major cities of the country, where sulfur gasoline and diesel fuels (BS IV Fuel) are required and have been made available. Euro 4 norms are expected to apply in additional cities as BS IV fuels are made available in 2014 and 2015 in a phased manner.

South America

Certain countries follow the U.S. test procedures, standards and OBD requirements and others follow the EU test procedures, standards and OBD requirements with different levels of stringency. Brazil implemented national L5 low emission vehicle standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2009. L6 standards for light diesel vehicles were implemented in 2012 and mandate OBD installation for light diesel vehicles in 2015. L6 standards for light gasoline vehicles are to be implemented in 2014 for new vehicles and 2015 for all models. Argentina implemented Euro 4 standards starting with new vehicle registrations in 2009 and the implementation of Euro 5 standards has been delayed from 2014 to 2015 for new vehicles and from 2016 to 2017 for all vehicles. Chile has enforced Euro 5 or U.S. Tier 2 Bin 5 emission standards for diesel vehicles and will implement Euro 5 or U.S. Tier 2 Bin 5 standards for gasoline vehicles in September 2014.

Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on environmental matters including site remediation.

Facility Management

To mitigate the effects our worldwide operations have on the environment we are committed to convert as many of our worldwide facilities as possible to landfill-free facilities. At December 31, 2013 85 (or over 50%) of our manufacturing facilities were landfill-free facilities. Additionally we have 25 non-manufacturing facilities that are landfill free. At our landfill-free manufacturing facilities approximately 96% of waste materials are recycled or reused and 4% is converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. Including construction, demolition and remediation wastes, we estimate that we recycled, reused, or composted over 2 million metric tons of waste materials at our global manufacturing operations and estimate that we converted approximately 75,000 metric tons of waste materials to energy at waste-to-energy facilities in the year ended December 31, 2013.

In 2013 we surpassed our internal 2020 Manufacturing Commitment initiative to reduce total waste on a kg/vehicle basis by 10%, having reduced total waste by more than 45 kg/vehicle (including metals and foundry-related wastes). Total waste includes all byproducts from routine manufacturing operations, excluding construction, demolition and remediation wastes and materials that are sent for direct reuse (without processing).

In addition to providing environmental benefits our landfill-free program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production by-products, reduce our energy costs, and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal.

We continue to make progress on our other 2020 Manufacturing commitments including the implementation of our global energy strategy with a goal to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency. Our data collection and management system is designed to monitor and measure energy use as well as calculate the related CO2 emissions including collecting and verifying energy, water and other environmental data from our facilities. Our approach to addressing climate change includes setting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, collecting accurate data, and by publicly reporting progress against our target.
 
Automotive Fuel Economy

North America

Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) reporting is required for three separate fleets: domestically produced cars, imported cars and light-duty trucks. Beginning with the 2011 model year both car and light-duty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes. In 2014 our domestic car standard is estimated to be 33.8 mpg, our import car standard is estimated at 37.2 mpg, and our light-duty truck standard is estimated to be 24.5 mpg. Our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal CAFE program.

In August 2012 the EPA and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) finalized a coordinated national program consisting of new requirements for the 2017 through 2025 model year light-duty vehicles that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. This regulation represents a continuation of the national program that has been established for the 2012 through 2016 model year light-duty vehicles. This program includes EPA and NHTSA standards that will require an industry-wide standard by 2016. Our current product plan projects compliance with both federal programs through 2016.

The CARB regulates greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles (which is the same as regulating fuel economy). This California program is currently established for the 2009 through 2016 model years. CARB has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the California program for the 2012 through 2016 model years.

A Canadian governmental agency implemented greenhouse gas standards that were harmonized with U.S. standards beginning with the 2011 model year. However these regulations do not require the separation of car fleet into domestic and import vehicles. The Province of Quebec had previously adopted standards for the 2009 through 2016 model years that were equivalent to the California program but has revised their regulations to allow compliance with the national standards effective with the 2012 model year.

Mexico has adopted fuel economy targets similar to the U.S. for 2012-2016 model years. The Mexico standards offer additional flexibilities when compared to the U.S. requirements to account for the differences in terrain type, vehicle mix and fuel quality. Discussions for post 2016 standards are expected to begin in 2014 calendar year.

Europe

Legislation regulating fleet average CO2 emissions was implemented for passenger cars in 2012. Based on a target function of CO2 to vehicle weight, each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific sales-weighted fleet average target. The fleet average requirement began phasing in during 2012 with full compliance required by 2015. Automobile manufacturers can earn super-credits for the sales volume of vehicles having a specific CO2 value. This is intended to encourage the early introduction of ultra-low CO2 vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera by providing an additional incentive to reduce the CO2 fleet average. Automobile manufacturers may gain credit for eco-innovations for those technologies which improve real-world fuel economy but may not show in the test cycle, such as solar panels on vehicles. There is also a 5% credit for FlexFuel vehicles if more than 30% of refueling stations in an EU Member State sell E85. Further regulatory detail is being developed. The legislation sets a target for 2020 with an impact assessment required to further assess and develop this requirement. We are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational CO2 targets for each market entry in Europe.

In 2011 the EU adopted a standard to regulate CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles. This regulation is modeled after the CO2 regulation for passenger cars. It proposes that new light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average CO2 target with a phase-in of compliance from 2014 and full compliance required by 2016. The manufacturer-specific CO2 compliance target will be determined as a function of the weight of the vehicle with all standard equipment and fuel (vehicle curb weight). Flexibilities such as eco-innovations and super credits are part of the regulatory proposal as well. An EU long-term target for 2020 has been adopted for light commercial vehicles. We have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational CO2 targets for each market entry in Europe.

In July 2012 the EU Commission released a regulatory proposal outlining the regulatory implementation for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles targets effective in 2020. Implementation of the target has been delayed with final release expected in early 2014. While the passenger car target is expected to remain in place beginning in 2020, in that first year (2020) only 95% of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) fleet is required to comply. Full 100% compliance will be required in 2021. The individual manufacturer targets will continue to be determined based on the average vehicle mass. Other compliance flexibilities will be limited adding additional challenges to compliance with the CO2 fleet target.

Effective in November 2012 an EC regulation required low-rolling resistance tires, tire pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators, which we adopted in 2011. An additional EC regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for noise, fuel efficiency and rolling resistance, affecting vehicles at the point of sale as well as the sale of tires in the aftermarket.

Seventeen EU Member States have introduced fuel consumption or CO2 based vehicle taxation schemes. Tax measures are within the jurisdiction of the EU Member States. We are faced with significant challenges relative to the predictability of future tax laws and differences in the tax schemes and thresholds.

International Operations

We face new or increasingly more stringent fuel economy standards in many countries. China has established new Phase 3 fuel economy standards supplementing the current Phase 2 pass-fail system with a corporate fleet average scheme based on vehicle curb weight for the 2012 through 2015 model years. Implementation began in 2012 with full compliance required by 2015. China has continued its retail subsidies for consumers for fuel efficient vehicles, extended range and plug-in, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. China is now working on a more aggressive Phase 4 fuel economy standard that is expected to apply to the 2016 through 2020 model years.

In Korea fuel economy/CO2 targets for 2012 through 2015 were implemented as part of the government's low carbon/green growth strategy. These targets are based on each vehicle's curb weight and in general are set at levels more stringent than fuel economy targets in the U.S. but less stringent than CO2 targets in the EU. The targets began being phased in during 2012 with full compliance by 2015 with manufacturers having the option to certify based on either fuel consumption or CO2 emissions. Each manufacturer has been given a corporate target to meet based on its overall industry fleet fuel economy/CO2 average. GM Korea Company's (GM Korea) current product portfolio is expected to comply with the targets by 2015. However, in 2014 the Korean

government plans to set more stringent fuel economy targets for 2016 and beyond that will likely reach the level in Japan by 2020 and the level in the EU by 2025.

In Saudi Arabia the government is developing a footprint-based fuel economy standard modeled on the U.S. system, which would likely commence in 2016 using the U.S. target value curves from 2011 or 2012. The Saudi program is not expected to include the alternative fuel/advanced technology vehicle and other credits from the U.S. program.

In India the government is developing a weight-based CO2/fuel efficiency regulation that is likely to be implemented in 2017. It is expected that the regulatory standards could be similar but less stringent than levels required in the EU with tighter standards planned for 2022.

In Australia the current government's agenda no longer includes the adoption of attribute-based CO2 standards.

South America

In Brazil the government has set new fuel economy requirements called INOVAR AUTO. OEMs have mandatory fleet average compliance required by October 2017 with a reduction from 2012 levels. The Brazilian government provides indirect tax incentives to eligible participant companies that meet certain requirements including these energy efficiency targets. The level of potential indirect tax incentives varies based on the degree and timing to which the targets are met. Participating companies that fail to meet the required criteria are subject to clawback provisions and specific fines.

In Chile every new passenger vehicle up to a certain vehicle weight is required to be tested under Euro procedure in order to determine its reference values to be included in the new mandatory fuel economy label. As a result of this process the label indicates the fuel consumption values for city, highway and combined city-highway and the CO2 emission values.

Chemical Regulations

We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry.
 
North America

Governmental agencies in both the U.S. and Canada continue to introduce new regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of safer chemical alternatives, green chemistry, life cycle assessment and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives will give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle life-cycle, including chemical substance selection for product development and manufacturing. These emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity.

In California two chemical initiatives will become effective in 2014: the brake pad reformulation law and the safer consumer products regulations. The brake pad reformulation law requires brake and vehicle manufacturers to ensure brakes produced after January 2014 meet limits for the amounts of certain heavy metals and are properly certified and labeled. Under the safer consumer products regulation, California EPA will begin regulating specific consumer products that contain chemicals of concern. It is not yet known when vehicle components will be targeted.

Europe

In 2007 the EU implemented its regulatory requirements, EU REACH regulation, to register, evaluate, authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances. This regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU in quantities of one metric ton or more per year to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency before 2018. During the pre-registration phase, Old GM and its suppliers registered those substances identified by this regulation. It is to be phased-in over a 10-year period. Under this regulation, 搒ubstances of very high concern?may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future. This could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts, or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines. Our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements.

Safety

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

In the U.S. if a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy. We are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints, warranty claims, field reports and notices and claims involving property damage, injuries and fatalities in the U.S. and claims involving fatalities outside the U.S. We are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the U.S.

Outside the U.S. safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the U.S. standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures. Other countries sometimes pass regulations which are more stringent than U.S. standards. Many countries require type approval while the U.S. and Canada require self-certification.

Vehicular Noise Control

In the U.S. passenger cars and light-duty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations. We identify the most stringent state and local requirements and validate to those requirements. Medium to heavy-duty trucks are regulated at the federal level. Federal truck regulations preempt all U.S. state or local noise regulations for trucks over a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 lbs.

Outside the U.S. noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and supranational level (e.g., EC or UNECE). We believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold. The EC has proposed new noise regulations that would mandate a significant decrease in vehicle noise emissions. These proposals are coupled with a new test procedure to better estimate the actual in-use noise emission of vehicles. The proposals of the EC also form the basis for amendment to UNECE vehicle regulations, with the expected effect that maximum noise regulations will become more stringent in all markets outside of North America. At this point, the final noise emission levels as well as the implementation timing of the final regulations are uncertain.

While current noise emission requirements regulate maximum allowable noise levels, formal proposals are under development to regulate minimum sound levels. These proposals stem from concern that relatively quiet vehicles, specifically hybrids and electrics, may not be readily heard by pedestrians. In the U.S., NHTSA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on January 14, 2013 and the U.S. Department of Transportation indicated a final rule is expected to be published in 2015. The UNECE is developing a Global Technical Regulation, sponsored by the U.S., Japan, and the EU, for manufacturers to equip vehicles with pedestrian alerting devices where the vehicle fails to meet minimum sound emission levels.

We are committed to designing and manufacturing vehicles to comply with these regulations and potential noise emission regulations that may come from these proposals.

Potential Effect of Regulations

We are actively working on aggressive near-term and long-term plans to develop and bring to market technologies designed to further reduce emissions, mitigate remediation expenses related to environmental liabilities, improve fuel efficiency, monitor and enhance the safety features of our vehicles and provide additional value and benefits to our customers. This is illustrated by our commitment to marketing more hybrid vehicles, our accelerated commitment to developing electrically powered vehicles, our use of biofuels in our expanded portfolio of FlexFuel vehicles and enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine technology which have contributed to the fuel efficiency of our vehicles. The conversion of many of our manufacturing facilities to landfill-free status has shown our commitment to mitigate potential environmental liability. We believe that the development and global implementation of new, cost-effective energy technologies in all sectors is the most effective way to improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate environmental liabilities.

Despite these advanced technology efforts, our ability to satisfy fuel economy, CO2 and other emissions requirements is contingent on various future economic, consumer, legislative and regulatory factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. If we are not able to comply with specific new requirements, which include higher CAFE standards and state CO2 requirements such as those which require the CARB to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, then we could be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance. Environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial. Violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, possible fines or a combination of any of those items. We must also cover the cost of repairs conducted under emission defect and performance warranties which apply for specified periods of time and mileage. In turn any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.

Pension Legislation

We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal rules and regulations including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which govern the manner in which we fund and administer our pension plans. In July 2012 the U.S. government enacted the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act which allows plan sponsors funding relief for U.S. pension plans through the application of higher funding interest rates. Under current economic conditions we expect the new law to further delay required contributions to our U.S. pension plans. The new law does not impact our reported funded status.

Export Control

We are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations and most countries in which we do business have applicable export controls. Our Office of Export Compliance and our global Export Compliance Officers are responsible for working with our business units to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations.

Automotive Financing - GM Financial

GM Financial is our captive automotive finance company that has been operating since 1992. GM Financial conducts its business in North America and, as a result of the 2013 acquisition of the Ally Financial international operations, in Europe and Latin America. GM Financial expects to complete in 2014 the acquisition of Ally Financial's equity interest in GMAC-SAIC Automotive Finance Company Limited (GMAC-SAIC) that conducts automotive finance and financial services operations in China.

GM Financial automobile finance programs in North America include sub-prime lending and full spectrum leasing. The sub-prime lending programs predominantly offer financing to consumers who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions. The typical borrower has experienced prior credit difficulties or has limited credit history and generally has a credit bureau score ranging from 500 through 700. Since GM Financial provides financing in a relatively high-risk market it expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than other more traditional sources of financing. The full spectrum leasing product is offered through our franchised dealers and targets prime and sub-prime consumers leasing new vehicles. GM Financial seeks to provide competitive alternatives to existing marketplace lease offerings in our franchised dealers. GM Financial services its loan and lease portfolio at regional centers using automated servicing and collection systems.

In April 2012 and March 2013, GM Financial launched the U.S. and Canadian commercial lending platforms to further support our franchised dealerships and their affiliates. These platforms are centered on floor plan financing of dealer vehicle inventory and dealer loans to finance dealer sites, facilities, facility improvements and working capital. These loans are made on a secured basis.

GM Financial抯 international consumer lending programs focus on financing prime quality consumers purchasing our new and used vehicles. In many countries GM Financial also offers financial leases, a lease/retail hybrid product that includes a balloon payment at expiration, and finance-related insurance products through third parties, such as credit life, gap and extended warranty coverage. Commercial products offered to dealer customers include new and used vehicle inventory financing, inventory insurance, working capital and capital improvement loans. Other commercial products include fleet financing and storage center financing.

GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured bank lines, through public and private securitization transactions where such markets are developed and, to a lesser extent in Latin America, through public financing programs including the issuance of commercial paper and other financing programs.

GM Financial retains an interest in the securitization transactions in the form of restricted cash accounts and overcollateralization, whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the amount of asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts, as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by GM Financial over the life of the securitization. Excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset-backed securities net of credit losses and expenses.

Excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts. Once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained excess cash flows are distributed to GM Financial. In addition to excess cash flows GM Financial receives monthly base servicing fees and collects other fees such as late charges as servicer for securitization trusts.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

We face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. While we describe each risk separately, some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below.

Our business is highly dependent on sales volume. There is no assurance that the global automobile market will not suffer a significant downturn.

Our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales, including real estate values, levels of unemployment, the availability of credit, fluctuations in the cost of fuel and consumer confidence. We cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty and any change in economic and market conditions that negatively affects sales volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to maintain profitability over the long-term is dependent upon our ability to introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers.

Our ability to maintain profitability over the long-term depends on our ability to entice consumers to consider our products when purchasing a new vehicle. The automotive industry, particularly in the U.S., is very competitive with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet consumer expectations, and in the past our competitors have been very successful in persuading customers that previously purchased our products to purchase their vehicles instead. Producing new and improved vehicle models on a basis competitive with the models introduced by our competitors and changing any negative perception, in light of Old GM's bankruptcy, will be critical to our long-term profitability. We will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2014. A successful launch of our new vehicles is critical to our short term profitability.

The pace of our development and introduction of new and improved vehicles depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design, engineering and manufacturing, which requires extensive capital investment. In some cases the technologies that we plan to employ, such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology, are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers. There can be no assurance that our competitors and others pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. If we are unable to achieve these goals, we may not be able to maintain profitability over the long-term.

Shortages of and volatility in the price of oil have caused and may have a material adverse effect on our business due to shifts in consumer vehicle demand.

Volatile oil prices in recent years have tended to cause a shift in consumer demand towards smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, which provide lower profit margins. Any increases in the price of oil in the U.S. or in our other markets or any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of political instability in the Middle East, South America and African nations, could weaken the demand for our higher margin fullsize pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles, which could reduce our market share in affected markets, decrease profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our future competitiveness and ability to achieve long-term profitability depends on our ability to control our costs, which requires us to successfully implement restructuring initiatives throughout our automotive operations.

We are continuing to implement a number of cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives in our automotive operations, including labor modifications and substantial restructuring initiatives. Our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our automotive operations. While some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control, others such as interest rates or return on investments, which influence our expense for pensions, depend more on external factors, and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs. Reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expenses necessary to improve the performance, safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles are likely to increase.

Our automotive manufacturing operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to provide us with systems, components and parts and any disruption in our suppliers' operations could disrupt our production schedule and adversely affect our operations.

Our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Our use of 搄ust-in-time?manufacturing processes results in our having minimal inventories of the systems, components and parts we need to conduct our automotive manufacturing operations. As a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of systems, components and parts at such times as allow us to meet our production schedules. In some instances we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Where we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely and thus could adversely affect our financial results.

Increase in cost, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could materially harm our business.

We use various raw materials in our business including steel, non-ferrous metals such as aluminum and copper, and precious metals such as platinum and palladium. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. In recent years freight charges and raw material costs increased. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Some of these raw materials, such as corrosion-resistant steel, are only available from a limited number of suppliers. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers. An increase in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials, which may be caused by a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers or by events such as labor strikes, could negatively affect our net revenues and profitability to a material extent.

We operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results.

The global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand. Many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs. Our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by attempting to sell more vehicles by adding vehicle enhancements, providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering option package discounts or other marketing incentives, or reducing vehicle prices in certain markets. Manufacturers in lower cost countries such as China and India have emerged as competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention of exporting their products to established markets as a bargain alternative to entry-level automobiles. These actions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results, and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle.

Our competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by industry consolidation or alliances.

Designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in manufacturing, machinery, research and development, product design, engineering, technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and regulatory requirements. Large original equipment manufacturers are able to benefit from economies of scale by leveraging their investments and activities on a global basis across brands and nameplates. If our competitors consolidate or enter into other strategic agreements such as alliances, they may be able to take better advantage of these economies of scale. We believe that competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by consolidation or alliances, which could adversely affect

18


Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

our competitiveness with respect to those competitors. Competitors could use consolidation or alliances as a means of enhancing their competitiveness or liquidity position, which could also materially adversely affect our business.

Our business plan contemplates that we restructure our operations in various European countries, but we may not succeed in doing so, and our failure to restructure these operations in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

In 2013 the European automotive industry continued to be severely affected by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis, high unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence coupled with overcapacity.

In response we are executing various actions to strengthen our European operations and increase our competitiveness. The key areas of the plan include:

?
investments in our product portfolio;
?
a revised brand strategy;
?
significant management changes;
?
reducing material, development and production costs; and
?
leveraging synergies from the alliance between us and Peugeot S.A. (PSA).

Notwithstanding the above we believe it is likely that adverse economic conditions and their effect on the European automotive industry will not improve significantly in the short-term and we expect to continue to incur losses in the region as a result. In addition the success of our plan will depend on a combination of our ability to execute the actions contemplated, as well as external factors, which are outside of our control. Our inability to successfully restructure our European operations and implement our plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates and investments that do not achieve adequate returns.

Our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. A detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is disclosed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.

There are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market capacity to absorb a particular investment strategy or high volume transactions and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.

Our future funding requirement for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans qualified with the Internal Revenue Service depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations. Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, as other factors are held constant. Our potential funding requirements are described in 揗anagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations -- Contractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities.?

Factors which affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans outside the U.S., we could be required to contribute more funds, which would negatively affect our cash flow.

We rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our dealers and customers in a majority of the markets in which we sell vehicles. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing, prime and sub-prime financing to consumers and commercial lending to our dealers to support additional sales of our vehicles.

In North America GM Financial supports additional consumer leasing of our vehicles and additional sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring sub-prime vehicle financing as well as providing commercial lending to our dealers. In Europe and South America we rely on GM Financial to support additional consumer leasing of our vehicles and additional sales of our vehicles to

19

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

prime consumers as well as providing commercial lending to our dealers. GM Financial is subject to various risks that could negatively affect its business, operations and access to capital and therefore its ability to provide leasing, prime and sub-prime financing options at competitive rates to consumers of our vehicles and commercial lending to our dealers. Because we rely on GM Financial to serve as an additional source of leasing, prime and sub-prime financing options for consumers and commercial lending to our dealers, any impairment of GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to expand our market penetration among consumers who rely on these financial services to acquire new vehicles and dealers who seek financing. The factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and impair its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include:

?
The ability to close the acquisition of GMAC-SAIC and integrate the acquired Ally Financial international operations into its business successfully;

?
The availability of borrowings under its credit facilities to fund its consumer and dealer finance activities pending securitization;

?
Its ability to transfer finance receivables and leases to securitization trusts and sell securities in the asset-backed securities market to generate cash proceeds to repay its credit facilities and fund additional finance receivables and leases;

?
The performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by delinquencies, defaults or prepayments;

?
Wholesale auction values of used vehicles;

?
Higher than expected vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles GM Financial leases; and

?
Fluctuations in interest rates and currencies.

The above factors, alone or in combination, could negatively affect GM Financial's business and operations or its ability to provide leasing, prime and sub-prime financing options to consumers to support additional sales of our vehicles and dealer financing.

Our planned investment in new technology in the future is significant and may not be funded at anticipated levels and, even if funded at anticipated levels, may not result in successful vehicle applications.

We intend to invest significant capital resources to support our products and to develop new technology. In addition we plan to invest heavily in alternative fuel and advanced propulsion technologies between 2014 and 2015, largely to support our planned expansion of hybrid and electric vehicles. Moreover if our future operations do not provide us with the cash flow we anticipate, we may be forced to reduce, delay or cancel our planned investments in new technology.

In some cases the technologies that we plan to employ, such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology, are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by suppliers. There can be no assurance that these advances will occur in a timely or feasible way, that the funds that we have budgeted for these purposes will be adequate or that we will be able to establish our right to these technologies. However our competitors and others are pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies and there can be no assurance that they will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage.

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information.

We rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain management, manufacturing, invoicing and collection of payments from our dealer network and from customers of GM Financial. Additionally we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the propriety business information of our dealers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to our

20

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

networks and systems, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations and reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to significant security attacks or disruptions resulting from such attacks.

New laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding increased fuel economy requirements and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones, may have a significant effect on how we do business.

We are affected significantly by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the related costs and changes to our product lineup, will increase significantly in the future. In the U.S. and Europe, for example, governmental regulation is driven primarily by concerns about the environment (including greenhouse gas emissions), vehicle safety, fuel economy and energy security. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and may result in substantial costs, including civil penalties. They may also result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect revenue.

In the U.S. vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the NHTSA and the EPA. The agencies have set coordinated fuel economy and greenhouse emission standards through the 2025 model year for light duty vehicles and through the 2018 model year for heavy duty trucks. California, which has set its own greenhouse gas emission standards through its AB 1493 Rules, has agreed to accept compliance with the national program as compliance with its state program.

We are committed to meeting or exceeding these U.S. regulatory requirements, and our product plan of record projects compliance with the anticipated national program through the 2021 model year. The standards for the 2022 through 2025 model years may be adjusted as a result of a mid-term review by the agencies. Therefore we believe it is premature to project compliance with possible standards for those years. We expect that to comply with these standards we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles, as well as implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all at increased cost levels. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis, or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs.

The EU passed legislation, effective in April 2009, that began regulating vehicle CO2 emissions in 2012. The legislation sets a target of a fleet average of 95 grams per kilometer for 2020, with the requirements for each manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicles it sells. Additional measures have been proposed or adopted in Europe to regulate features such as tire rolling resistance, vehicle air conditioners, tire pressure monitors, gear shift indicators and others. At the national level 17 EU Member States have adopted some form of fuel consumption or carbon dioxide-based vehicle taxation system, which could result in specific market requirements for us to introduce technology earlier than is required for compliance with the EU emissions standards.

Other governments around the world, such as Canada, China, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea are also creating or have new policies to address these same issues. As in the U.S. these government policies could significantly affect our plans for product development. Due to these regulations we could be subject to sizable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance. The regulations will result in substantial costs, which could be difficult to pass through to our customers, and could result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which could affect our operations, including facility closings, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.

A significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit.

Many of our operations, particularly in emerging markets, are carried out by joint ventures such as SGM. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes or relationships deteriorate, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. The benefits

21


Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures.

Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions.

Maintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. The automotive market in China is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. As the size of the Chinese market continues to increase, we anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, will seek to enter the Chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. In addition our business in China is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in China. If we are unable to maintain our position in the Chinese market or if vehicle sales in China decrease or do not continue to increase, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.

We could be materially adversely affected by changes or imbalances in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

Given the nature of the automotive industry and global spread of our business, we have significant exposures to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which can have material adverse effects on our business. In preparing the consolidated financial statements we translate our revenues and expenses outside the U.S. into U.S. Dollars using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the period and the assets and liabilities using the foreign currency exchange rate at the balance sheet date. As a result foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our businesses outside the U.S. expose us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our business.

The majority of our vehicles are sold outside the U.S. We are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the U.S. Operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political, economic and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including:

?
Economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, such as China;

?
Economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade and investment policies, including imposing restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, especially between the U.S. and China;

?
Foreign regulations restricting our ability to sell our products in those countries;

?
Differing local product preferences and product requirements, including fuel economy, vehicle emissions and safety;

?
Liabilities resulting from U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws;

?
Differing labor regulations and union relationships;

?
Consequences from changes in tax laws;

?
Difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and

?
Political and economic instability, natural calamities, war and terrorism.

The effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our business.

New laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding safety standards, or changes in existing ones, may have a significant negative effect on how we do business.

Our products must satisfy legal safety requirements. Meeting or exceeding government-mandated safety standards is difficult and costly because crashworthiness standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. While we are managing our product development and production operations on a global basis to

reduce costs and lead times, unique national or regional standards or vehicle rating programs can result in additional costs for product development, testing and manufacturing. Governments often require the implementation of new requirements during the middle of a product cycle, which can be substantially more expensive than accommodating these requirements during the design of a new product.

The costs and effect on our reputation of product recalls could materially adversely affect our business.

From time to time we recall our products to address performance, compliance or safety-related issues. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. In addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. Any costs incurred or lost sales caused by future product recalls could materially adversely affect our business. Conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

NoneA. Risk Factors. We have listed below (not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence) the most significant risk factors applicable to us: Decline in industry sales volume, particularly in the United States or Europe, due to financial crisis, recession, geopolitical events, or other factors. In the fall of 2008, the global economy entered a financial crisis and severe recession, putting significant pressure on both Ford and the automotive industry generally. These economic conditions dramatically reduced automotive industry sales volume in the United States and Europe, in particular, and began to slow growth in other markets around the world. U.S. automotive industry sales volume declined from 16.5 million units in 2007 to 13.5 million units in 2008 and 10.6 million units in 2009, before rebounding to 15.9 million units in 2013. For the 19 markets we tracked in Europe, automotive industry sales volume declined steadily from 18 million units in 2007 to 13.8 million units in 2013. Because we, like other manufacturers, have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, relatively small changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and profitability. If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption, particularly in the United States or Europe, due to financial crisis, recession, geopolitical events, or other factors, our financial condition and results of operations would be substantially adversely affected. For discussion of economic trends, see the “Overview” section of Item 7. Decline in Ford’s market share or failure to achieve growth. To maintain competitive economies of scale and grow our global market share, we must grow our market share in fast-growing newly-developed and emerging markets, particularly in our Asia Pacific region and our Middle East and Africa region, as well as maintain or grow market share in mature markets. Our market share in certain growing markets, such as China, is lower than it is in our mature markets. A significant decline in our market share in mature markets or failure to achieve growth in newly-developing or emerging markets, whether due to capacity constraints, competitive pressures, protectionist trade policies, or other factors, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of Ford’s new or existing products. Although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products in the marketplace. Offering highly desirable vehicles that customers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but vehicles that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, fuel efficiency, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. For example, if a new model were to experience quality issues at the time of launch, the vehicle’s perceived quality could be affected even after the issues had been corrected, resulting in lower sales volumes, market share, and profitability. In addition, with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet and other media, mere allegations relating to quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate social responsibility, or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products, even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded. Market shift away from sales of larger, more profitable vehicles beyond Ford’s current planning assumption, particularly in the United States. A shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles at levels beyond our current planning assumption could result in an immediate and substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, when gasoline prices in the United States spiked to more than $4.00 per gallon in 2008 and the construction industry suddenly slowed, consumer preferences quickly and dramatically shifted away from larger, more profitable vehicles and into smaller vehicles. We estimate that shifting consumer preferences across all vehicle segments adversely impacted our Automotive operating pre-tax earnings and cash flow in 2008 by about $1.3 billion. Although we now have a more balanced portfolio of small, medium, and large cars, utilities, and trucks that generally are more fuel efficient and contribute higher margins than in 2008, as well as a lower cost structure, a shift in consumer preferences away from sales of larger, more profitable vehicles at levels greater than our current planning assumption - whether because of spiking fuel prices, a decline in the construction industry, government actions or incentives, or other reasons - still could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. An increase in or continued volatility of fuel prices, or reduced availability of fuel. An increase in fuel prices, continued price volatility, or reduced availability of fuel, particularly in the United States, could result in weakening of demand for relatively more-profitable large cars, utilities, and trucks, while increasing demand for relatively lessprofitable small vehicles. Continuation or acceleration of such a trend beyond our current planning assumption, or volatility in demand across segments, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 18 Continued or increased price competition resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, or other factors. The global automotive industry is intensely competitive, with manufacturing capacity far exceeding current demand. According to the January 2014 report issued by IHS Automotive, the global automotive industry is estimated to have had excess capacity of 23 million units in 2013. Industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share; these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates, and other incentives. As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher costs of marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations, including pricing advantages foreign competitors may have because of their weaker home market currencies. Continuation of or increased excess capacity could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. As a resourceintensive manufacturing operation, we are exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged. In addition, because of intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be able to address such changes even if foreseeable. As a result, substantial unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See “Overview” to Item 7 and Item 7A for additional discussion of currency, commodity price, and interest rate risks. Adverse effects resulting from economic, geopolitical, or other events. With the increasing interconnectedness of global economic and financial systems, a financial crisis, natural disaster, geopolitical crisis, or other significant event in one area of the world can have an immediate and devastating impact on markets around the world. For example, the financial crisis that began in the United States in 2008 quickly spread to other markets; natural disasters in Japan and Thailand during 2011 caused production interruptions and delays not just in Asia Pacific but other regions around the world; and episodes of increased geopolitical tensions or acts of terrorism in the Middle East or elsewhere have at times caused adverse reactions that may spread to economies around the globe. Although confidence is improving, residual concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain of the countries that have adopted the euro currency (“euro area countries”) and the ability of these countries to meet future financial obligations, as well as concerns regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual euro area countries. If a country within the euro area were to default on its debt or withdraw from the euro currency, or—in a more extreme circumstance—the euro currency were to be dissolved entirely, the impact on markets around the world, and on Ford’s global business, could be immediate and significant. Such a scenario—or the perception that such a development is imminent—could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations. In addition, such a development could cause financial and capital markets within and outside Europe to constrict, thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business, and also could cause a substantial dip in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact sales of vehicles. Any one of these impacts could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. While the U.S. federal government budget deficit has fallen since 2010, there is risk associated with the high level of federal government debt and the sustainability of the nation’s budget. Further government action will be necessary to put the federal government budget on a stable and sustainable path. The potential for disruptions associated with an unsustainable federal budget is a risk to both consumers and businesses. In addition, we have operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments and are pursuing growth opportunities in a number of newly-developed and emerging markets. These investments may expose us to heightened risks of economic, geopolitical, or other events, including governmental takeover (i.e., nationalization) of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities, and acts of terrorism, each of which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 19 Economic distress of suppliers that may require Ford to provide substantial financial support or take other measures to ensure supplies of components or materials and could increase costs, affect liquidity, or cause production constraints or disruptions. The automotive industry supply base experienced increased economic distress due to the sudden and substantial drop in industry sales volumes beginning in 2008. Dramatically lower industry sales volume made existing debt obligations and fixed cost levels difficult for many suppliers to manage, increasing pressure on the supply base. As a result, suppliers not only were less willing to reduce prices, but some requested direct or indirect price increases as well as new and shorter payment terms. At times, we have had to provide financial assistance to key suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of materials and components. In addition, where suppliers have exited certain lines of business or closed facilities due to the economic downturn or other reasons, we generally experience additional costs associated with transitioning to new suppliers. Each of these factors could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Work stoppages at Ford or supplier facilities or other limitations on production (whether as a result of labor disputes, natural or man-made disasters, tight credit markets or other financial distress, production constraints or difficulties, or other factors). A work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Ford or supplier facilities for any number of reasons, including as a result of disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, or as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints or difficulties, or for other reasons. Recent examples of situations that have affected industry production to varying degrees include: supplier financial distress due to reduced production volumes during the economic downturn in 2008–2009; capacity constraints as suppliers that restructured or downsized during the downturn work to satisfy growing industry volumes; short-term constraints on production as consumer preferences shift more fluidly across vehicle segments and features; and the impact on certain suppliers of natural disasters during 2011. As indicated, a work stoppage or other limitations on production at Ford or supplier facilities for any reason (including but not limited to labor disputes, natural or man-made disasters, tight credit markets or other financial distress, or production constraints or difficulties) could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Single-source supply of components or materials. Many components used in our vehicles are available only from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier (due to long lead times, new contractual commitments that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials, etc.). In addition to the general risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to a component. Labor or other constraints on Ford’s ability to maintain competitive cost structure. Substantially all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations in the United States and Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. We negotiated a four-year agreement with the UAW in 2011, and a fouryear agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers Union in 2012. Although we have negotiated transformational agreements in recent years, these agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and some degree of employment security, subject to certain conditions. As a practical matter, these agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses. A substantial number of our employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils, and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state, country, or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facilities. Substantial pension and postretirement health care and life insurance liabilities impairing liquidity or financial condition. We have defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover our hourly and salaried employees. We also provide pension benefits to non-U.S. employees and retirees, primarily in Europe. In addition, we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor plans to provide other postretirement benefits (“OPEB”) for retired employees (primarily health care and life insurance benefits). See Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans. These benefit plans impose significant liabilities on us that are not fully funded and will require additional cash contributions, which could impair our liquidity. Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 20 Our qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans are subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). Under Title IV of ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) has the authority under certain circumstances or upon the occurrence of certain events to terminate a qualified underfunded pension plan. One such circumstance is the occurrence of an event that unreasonably increases the risk of unreasonably large losses to the PBGC. Although we believe it is unlikely that the PBGC would terminate any of our plans, in the event that our qualified U.S. pension plans were terminated at a time when the liabilities of the plans exceeded the assets of the plans we would incur a liability to the PBGC that could be equal to the entire amount of the underfunding. If our cash flows and capital resources were insufficient to fund our pension or OPEB obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Worse-than-assumed economic and demographic experience for postretirement benefit plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns). The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our postretirement benefit plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants. We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates). To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, there could be a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For discussion of our assumptions, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 and Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Restriction on use of tax attributes from tax law “ownership change.” Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its tax attributes, including net operating losses and tax credits (“Tax Attributes”). At December 31, 2013 we had Tax Attributes that would offset more than $15 billion of taxable income. For these purposes, an ownership change occurs if 5 percent shareholders of an issuer’s outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. In 2012, we renewed for an additional three-year period our tax benefit preservation plan (the “Plan”) to reduce the risk of an ownership change under Section 382. Under the Plan, shares held by any person who acquires, without the approval of our Board of Directors, beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of our outstanding Common Stock could be subject to significant dilution. Our shareholders approved the renewal at our annual meeting in May 2013. The discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs. Meeting or exceeding many government-mandated safety standards is costly and often technologically challenging, especially where standards may conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet government-mandated emissions and fuel-economy standards. Government safety standards also require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. In addition, the introduction of new and innovative features and technology to our vehicles could increase the risk of defects or customer dissatisfaction. Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety or other defect or a noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production, the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until such defect is remedied. The costs associated with any protracted delay in new model launches necessary to remedy such defects, or the cost of recall campaigns or warranty costs to remedy such defects in vehicles that have been sold, could be substantial. Furthermore, launch delays or recall actions also could adversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our products as discussed above under “Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of Ford’s new or existing products.” Increased safety, emissions, fuel economy, or other regulations resulting in higher costs, cash expenditures, and/or sales restrictions. The worldwide automotive industry is governed by a substantial amount of government regulation, which often differs by state, region, and country. Government regulation has arisen, and proposals for additional regulation are advanced, primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about the possibility of global climate change and its impact), vehicle safety, and energy independence. In addition, many governments regulate local product content and/or impose import requirements as a means of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, and influencing the balance of payments. Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 21 In recent years, we have made significant changes to our product cycle plan to improve the overall fuel economy of vehicles we produce, thereby reducing their GHG emissions. There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given timeframe, however, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies, consumer acceptance of new technologies and changes in vehicle mix, willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies, the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new technologies, and the human, engineering, and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time. The cost to comply with existing government regulations is substantial, and future, additional regulations could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For more discussion of the impact of such standards on our global business, see the “Governmental Standards” discussion in “Item 1. Business” (“Item 1”) above. In addition, a number of governments, as well as nongovernmental organizations, publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols. The protocols could change aggressively, and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales. Unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise. We spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with governmental safety regulations, mobile and stationary source emissions regulations, and other standards. Compliance with governmental standards, however, does not necessarily prevent individual or class actions, which can entail significant cost and risk. In certain circumstances, courts may permit tort claims even where our vehicles comply with federal and/or other applicable law. Furthermore, simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards, whether related to our products or business or commercial relationships, may require significant expenditures of time and other resources. Litigation also is inherently uncertain, and we could experience significant adverse results. In addition, adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have a significant adverse effect on our sales. A change in requirements under long-term supply arrangements committing Ford to purchase minimum or fixed quantities of certain parts, or to pay a minimum amount to the seller (“take-or-pay” contracts). We have entered into a number of long-term supply contracts that require us to purchase a fixed quantity of parts to be used in the production of our vehicles. If our need for any of these parts were to lessen, we could still be required to purchase a specified quantity of the part or pay a minimum amount to the seller pursuant to the take-or-pay contract, which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Adverse effects on results from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments. We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, and tax abatements or credits. The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period. For example, most of our manufacturing facilities in South America are located in Brazil, where the state or federal governments have historically offered, and continue to offer, significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment, increase manufacturing production, and create jobs. As a result, the performance of our South American operations has been impacted favorably by government incentives to a substantial extent as we have increased our investment and manufacturing presence in Brazil, and we expect this favorable impact to continue for the next several years. In Brazil, the federal government has levied assessments against us concerning our calculation of federal incentives we received, and certain states have challenged the grant to us of tax incentives by the state of Bahia, including a constitutional challenge of state incentives that is pending in Brazil’s Supreme Court. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting for government incentives, and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for discussion of tax proceedings in Brazil. Inherent limitations of internal controls impacting financial statements and safeguarding of assets. Our internal control over financial reporting and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement accuracy and safeguarding of assets. Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 22 Cybersecurity risks to operational systems, security systems, or infrastructure owned by Ford, Ford Credit, or a third-party vendor or supplier. We are at risk for interruptions, outages, and breaches of: (i) operational systems (including business, financial, accounting, product development, consumer receivables, data processing, or manufacturing processes); (ii) facility security systems; and/or (iii) in-vehicle systems or mobile devices. Such cyber incidents could materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information of customers, employees, or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; and/or affect the performance of in-vehicle systems. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated, targeted methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses. An incident might not be detected in time to prevent a breach of these systems. Such incident could harm our reputation and subject us to regulatory actions or litigation. Failure of financial institutions to fulfill commitments under committed credit and liquidity facilities. Under our Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2006, as amended and restated on November 24, 2009 and as further amended (“Credit Agreement”), we are able to borrow, repay, and then re-borrow up to $10.7 billion until the facilities thereunder terminate in 2017. If the financial institutions that provide these or other committed credit facilities were to default on their obligation to fund the commitments, these facilities would not be available to us, which could substantially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. For discussion of our Credit Agreement, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 and Note 15 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Inability of Ford Credit to access debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts, due to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors. Ford Credit’s ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent on its credit ratings or its perceived creditworthiness. Ford Credit’s ability to obtain securitized funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other asset-backed securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit’s ability to obtain appropriate credit ratings and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk. Over time, and particularly in the event of any credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints. In addition, Ford Credit may be limited in the amount of receivables it purchases or originates in certain countries or regions if the local capital markets, particularly in developing countries, do not exist or are not adequately developed. Similarly, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions. A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit purchases or originates would significantly reduce its ongoing profits and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles. Higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles. Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s or dealer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms. Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, dealer profitability, and used car prices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit’s business. The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Ford Credit projects expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the vehicles it leases. Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which would reduce the profitability of the lease transaction. Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume of vehicles returned, economic conditions, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or reliability of the vehicles. Actual return volumes may be higher than expected and can be influenced by contractual lease-end values relative to auction values, marketing programs for new vehicles, and general economic conditions. Each of these factors, alone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credit’s profitability if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credit’s projections. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 for additional discussion. Increased competition from banks or other financial institutions seeking to increase their share of financing Ford vehicles. No single company is a dominant force in the automotive finance industry. Most of Ford Credit’s bank competitors in the United States use credit aggregation systems that permit dealers to send, through standardized systems, retail credit applications to multiple finance sources to evaluate financing options offered by these sources. This process drives greater competition based on financing rates. In addition, Ford Credit may face increased competition on wholesale financing for Ford dealers. Competition from such institutions with lower borrowing costs may increase, which could adversely affect Ford Credit’s profitability and the volume of its business. Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued) 23 New or increased credit, consumer, or data protection or other regulations resulting in higher costs and/or additional financing restrictions. As a finance company, Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations in which it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the United States, for example, Ford Credit’s operations are subject to regulation, supervision, and licensing under various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act. Congress also passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection Act (“Act”) in 2010 to reform practices in the financial services industries, including automotive financing and securitizations. The Act directs federal agencies to adopt rules to regulate the consumer finance industry and the capital markets and, among other things, gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) broad rule-making and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer finance protection laws that regulate consumer finance businesses, such as Ford Credit’s retail automotive financing business. Exercise of these powers by the CFPB may increase the costs of, impose additional restrictions on, or otherwise adversely affect companies in the automotive finance business. For example, in March 2013, the CFPB issued a bulletin recommending that indirect vehicle lenders, a class that includes Ford Credit, take steps to monitor and/or impose controls over dealer discretionary pricing. In addition, the Act provides that a non-bank financial company could be designated a “systemically important financial institution” by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and thus be subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Such a designation would mean that a non-bank finance company such as Ford Credit, in effect, could be regulated like a bank with respect to capital and other requirements, but without the benefits of being a bank—such as the ability to offer Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured deposits. The Act also creates an alternative liquidation framework under which the FDIC may be appointed as receiver of a non-bank financial company if the U.S. Treasury Secretary (in consultation with the President of the United States) determines that the company is in default or danger of default and the resolution of the company under other applicable law (e.g., U.S. bankruptcy law) would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. The FDIC’s powers under this framework may vary from those of a bankruptcy court under U.S. bankruptcy law, which could adversely impact securitization markets, including Ford Credit’s funding activities, regardless of whether Ford Credit ever is determined to be subject to the Act’s alternative liquidation framework. In some countries outside the United States, some of Ford Credit’s subsidiaries are regulated banking institutions and are required, among other things, to maintain minimum capital reserves. In many other locations, governmental authorities require companies to have licenses in order to conduct financing businesses. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes additional costs on Ford Credit and affects the conduct of its business. Additional regulation could add significant cost or operational constraints that might impair Ford Credit’s profitability. Key Economic Factors and Trends Affecting the Automotive Industry Currency Exchange Rate Volatility. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun reducing the pace of financial asset purchases, and the resulting shifts in capital flows have contributed to downward pressure on several emerging market currencies. In some cases that pressure is aggravated by high inflation, unstable policy environments, or both. Additionally, the yen has depreciated significantly over the last year as a result of policy changes by the Japanese government and Bank of Japan. This adds significant potential downward pressure on vehicle pricing across many markets globally. In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile. In some other markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments. Excess Capacity. According to IHS Automotive, an automotive research firm, the estimated automotive industry global production capacity for light vehicles of about 107 million units exceeded global production by about 23 million units in 2013. In North America and Europe, the two regions where the majority of industry revenue and profits are earned, excess capacity as a percent of production in 2013 was an estimated 7% and 34%, respectively. In China, the auto industry also witnessed excess capacity at 31% of production in 2013, as manufacturers competed to capitalize on China’s future market potential. According to production capacity data projected by IHS Automotive, global excess capacity conditions could continue for several years at an average of about 25 million units per year during the period from 2014 to 2018. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 34 Pricing Pressure. Excess capacity, coupled with a proliferation of new products being introduced in key segments, will keep pressure on manufacturers’ ability to increase prices. In North America, the industry restructuring of the past few years has allowed manufacturers to better match production with demand, although Japanese and Korean manufacturers also have capacity (located outside of the region) directed to North America. In the future, Chinese and Indian manufacturers are expected to enter U.S. and European markets, further intensifying competition. Although there has been a modest increase in new vehicle pricing in the U.S. market during 2013, it seems likely that over the long term intense competition and excess capacity will continue to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarlycontented vehicles in the United States and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry. In Europe, the excess capacity situation was exacerbated by weakening demand and the lack of reductions in existing capacity, such that negative pricing pressure is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Commodity and Energy Price Increases. Despite weak demand conditions, light sweet crude oil prices increased from an average of $79 per barrel in 2010 to $95 per barrel in 2011, before declining slightly to about $94 per barrel in late 2012. In 2013, oil prices rose slightly to $98 per barrel. Commodity prices have declined recently, but over the longer term prices are likely to trend higher given global demand growth. Vehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line. In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle segments. For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was about 130% of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. As we execute our One Ford plan, we are working to create best-in-class vehicles on global platforms that contribute higher margins, and offering a more balanced portfolio of vehicles with which we aim to be among the leaders in fuel efficiency in every segment in which we compete. Increasing Sales of Smaller Vehicles. Like other manufacturers, we are increasing our participation in newlydeveloped and emerging markets, such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China, in which vehicle sales are expected to increase at a faster rate than in most mature markets. The largest segments in these markets are small vehicles (i.e., Sub-B, B, and C segments). To increase our participation in these fast-growing markets, we are significantly increasing our production capacity, directly or through joint ventures. In addition, we expect that increased demand for smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles will continue in the mature markets of North America and Europe and, consequently, we have seen and expect in the future strong demand in those markets for our small car offerings (including our new Ford Fiesta and Focus models that are based on global platforms). Although we expect positive contribution margins from higher small vehicle sales, one result of increased production of small vehicles may be that, over time, our average per unit margin decreases because small vehicles tend to have lower margins than medium and large vehicles. Trade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions erect or intensify barriers to imports, or implement currency policy that advantages local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in markets that promote free trade. While we believe the long-term trend is toward the growth of free trade, we have noted with concern recent developments in a number of regions. In Asia Pacific Africa, for example, the recent dramatic depreciation of the yen significantly reduces the cost of exports into the United States, Europe, and other global markets by Japanese manufacturers. Over a period of time, the emerging weakness of the yen can contribute to other countries pursuing weak currency policies by intervening in the exchange rate markets. This is particularly likely in other Asian countries, such as South Korea. As another example, government actions in South America to incentivize local production and balance trade are driving trade frictions between South American countries and also with Mexico, resulting in business environment instability and new trade barriers. We will continue to monitor and address developing issues around trade policy. Other Economic Factors. The eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, with potentially higher long-term interest rates, could drive a higher cost of capital over our planning period. Higher interest rates and/or taxes to address the higher deficits also may impede real growth in gross domestic product and, therefore, vehicle sales over our planning period. For additional information on our assessment of the business environment, refer to the “Outlook” section below. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 35 Trends and Strategies We remain firm in our belief that our continued focus on executing the four key priorities of our One Ford plan enables us to go further for our customers, dealers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, and other key constituencies: • Aggressively restructure to operate profitably at the current demand and changing model mix; • Accelerate development of new products our customers want and value; • Finance our plan and improve our balance sheet; and • Work together effectively as one team, leveraging our global assets. Despite the external economic environment in recent years, we have made significant progress in transforming our business. Aggressively Restructure to Operate Profitably Brands. In recent years, we have eliminated a number of brands from our portfolio in order to devote fully our financial, product development, production, and marketing and sales and services resources toward growing our Ford and Lincoln brands. Manufacturing. We are committed to maintaining an appropriate manufacturing footprint in markets around the world, both in the more mature markets in which we have an established presence, and in fast-growing newly-developed and emerging markets. We are making substantial investments in newly-developed and emerging markets, including in China, India, and Thailand, to increase our production capacity with flexible new manufacturing plants. We and our unconsolidated affiliates in Asia Pacific Africa have launched four new plants in the past two years, and have announced that we expect to complete six more plants in the region by mid-decade. We also are making substantial investments in North America to grow production, including the addition of 200,000 annual incremental units of production capacity during 2013 and significant hiring in the United States as part of our manufacturing capacity expansions. In 2014, we are increasing capacity or adding production at six of our assembly plants in the United States. In Europe, however, we are reducing our capacity. As part of our Europe transformation plan, we completed the planned closures of two manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom in 2013, and will close our Genk, Belgium manufacturing facility at the end of 2014. These and other actions are expected to reduce our employment levels and production capacity in Europe, excluding Russia, by 13% and 18%, respectively. Suppliers. We continue to work to strengthen our global supply base. As part of this process, we have been reducing the global number of production suppliers from 3,300 in 2004 to about 1,200 at year-end 2013. We have identified plans that will take us to a target of about 750 suppliers, and we are confident that our consolidation efforts will result in a stronger and healthier supply base. We continue to work closely with our suppliers to address any near-term capacity constraints as we continue to ramp up production. In addition, our move to global vehicle platforms increases our ability to source to common suppliers for the total global volume of vehicle components resulting in a smaller number of suppliers receiving a greater volume of purchases to support our global vehicle platforms and allowing us to gain greater economies of scale. Ford and Lincoln Dealerships. We have over 11,000 dealerships worldwide. Our dealers are a source of strength around the world, representing the face of Ford to our customers and local communities. Our goal is to achieve a profitable dealer network by rightsizing the number of dealerships, identifying the right locations with modern facilities that deliver an innovative and engaging sales and service experience for our retail customers. In 2013, we added about 100 dealers in China, bringing the total number of Ford dealers in China to more than 600. We plan to add dealers in other growth markets as well. In the United States, our Ford and Lincoln network had about 3,260 outlets at the end of 2013. Product Development. Our One Ford global product development system is fully operationalized, utilizing global platforms to deliver customer-focused programs rapidly and efficiently across global markets. Through our “hub and satellite” approach, one lead product development engineering center—the hub—is assigned for each global vehicle line, thereby ensuring global scale and efficiency through common designs, parts, suppliers, and manufacturing processes. The hubs are supported by regional engineering centers - satellites - which also help deliver products tuned to local market customer preferences while maintaining global design DNA. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 36 Our One Ford global product development process utilizes global platforms to deliver customer-focused programs rapidly and efficiently across global markets. Significant progress has been made and continues on our commitment to consolidate platforms. In 2007, we utilized 27 different vehicle platforms; we now have 15 total platforms, and are on track to meet our target of nine core platforms globally. In 2013, about 85% of our global vehicle volume was produced off of nine global core platforms. By 2016, 99% of our global vehicle volume will come off of our nine global core platforms. We are able to reinvest the savings of this platform consolidation back into product development, introducing more products at a faster product cadence, and better profitability. Accelerate Development of New Products Our Customers Want and Value Our product launch schedule for 2014 is the most aggressive in our history. We will launch 23 all-new or significantly refreshed vehicles around the world—more than double the 11 global vehicles launched in 2013. In North America, we will have 16 launches—triple the number of vehicles launched in 2013. Globally, 150% of our product portfolio will change with all-new or significantly refreshed vehicles between 2014 and 2018. Our industry-leading refresh rate results in continuous improvement, and we expect to have the lowest average age for global passenger vehicles in 2014. During 2014, we will launch an all-new Mustang, which will be available in the United States this fall, in Europe in early 2015, and in China and other Asia-Pacific markets in 2015. Mustang will be available with three engines offering a broader power of choice, and world-class ride and handling enabled by a fully independent suspension. An all-new F-150 will be available in late 2014 with an all-new high-strength steel frame and advanced aluminum alloy body, which will result in up to 700 pounds of weight savings to help the F-150 tow more, haul more, accelerate quicker, and stop shorter, all with better gas mileage. The new F-150 also will introduce 11 new class-exclusive features, including a 360-degree camera view, integrated loading ramps stowed in the pickup bed, 400-watt power outlets inside the cab, LED headlights and sideview mirror spotlights, and remote tailgate release. Four engine choices will be available to provide unmatched power to meet almost any customer need. We remain committed to reinventing Lincoln into a world-class luxury brand with a client experience to match. Our Lincoln brand transformation began with the Lincoln MKZ which was completely redesigned for 2013. The Lincoln MKZ is the first of four all-new vehicles that we will be launching through 2016 as part of our reinvention. The Lincoln MKZ was named 2013’s best compact premium vehicle in the J.D. Power APEAL Study, with January 2014 sales in the United States up 368% year-over-year. In 2014, we are adding the Lincoln MKC to the Lincoln line-up, providing an entry in the important and fast-growing small premium utility segment, one of the fastest growing premium segments in both the United States and China. Our global product strategy is to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best in class vehicles—small, medium and large; cars, utilities and trucks; each delivering the highest quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design, and value—and delivering profitable growth for all. The fundamentals of our global product strategy are consistent, producing vehicles that: • Have bold, emotive exterior designs • Are great to drive • Are great to sit in (second home comfort, convenience, exceptional quietness) • Provide fuel economy as a reason to buy • Are unmistakably a Ford or Lincoln in look, sound, and feel • Provide exceptional value and quality Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 37 Developing products customers want and delivering value for Ford and Lincoln demands consistent focus on our commitment in four key areas—Quality, Green, Safe, and Smart. Quality. We have made significant strides toward improving quality since 2005. One way we track this is in the incidence of warranty repairs per 1,000 vehicles in the first 3 months of service. Global warranty repairs have fallen 66% from 2005 to 2013. As the incidence of repair has come down, so has the average warranty cost per unit in the first 3 months in service. Over the same period, global warranty repair cost per unit has improved by 54%, including improvements of more than 70% in Asia Pacific Africa, more than 60% in Europe and South America, and about 45% in North America. A challenge we have faced recently has been customer satisfaction issues brought on by the rapid rise in the level of consumer technology we have introduced in our vehicles. One area of significant focus is MyFord Touch. Since launch of the feature in the 2011 model year, we have reduced “Things Gone Wrong” (TGW) per affected unit by more than 50%. At the same time, we have introduced more products with MyFord Touch, and the demand for the technology remains high. In addition, overall vehicle customer satisfaction is higher on vehicles with MyFord Touch than those without. Two other areas of focus for us have been issues related to certain of our transmissions and some interior items. As we are doing with MyFord Touch, we have implemented high-leverage quality actions to address the transmission and interior issues. Green. Our commitment and approach to sustainability is unique in the industry. We prefer to provide our customers the power of choice, with a full technology range of gasoline, diesel, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric propulsion systems. We are also electrifying our most popular global platforms instead of one-off specialty models, so we have the manufacturing flexibility to balance our production to meet customer demand. For example, we produce vehicles with gas engines, EcoBoost, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and full electrics at our Michigan Assembly Plant. The EcoBoost engine is the centerpiece of our Blueprint for Sustainability. In 2009, we embarked on a strategy to populate our product line with a portfolio of modern engines that uses advanced technologies to deliver high power output but with smaller displacements to provide big gains in fuel economy and emissions. The first application of this strategy was the 3.5L V6 EcoBoost engine, which accounts for more than 125 patents on EcoBoost technology and was named one of Ward’s Ten Best Engines in 2010. The EcoBoost technology migrated to the I4 architectures in 2010 and the 2.0L EcoBoost was named one of Ward’s Ten Best Engines in 2012 and again in 2013. The 1.0L I3 EcoBoost launched in 2012 and was named International Engine of the Year in 2012 and again in 2013 by Engine Technology International magazine. Ward’s recently named the 1.0L EcoBoost one of its ten best engines for 2014. The 2014 Fiesta powered by the 1.0L EcoBoost delivers an EPA-estimated rating of 45 mpg on the highway, which is best-in-class highway fuel economy among all subcompacts offered in the United States. We have produced more than 2 million EcoBoost engines globally since we launched the engine line in 2009. With the upcoming launches of our MKC, Mustang and F-150, we will introduce the new 2.3L I4 EcoBoost and 2.7L V6 EcoBoost engines. The 2.3L I4 FWD/AWD configuration will be available on the MKC, generating 285 horsepower / 305 lb-ft torque. The 2.3L I4 RWD configuration for the Mustang will generate more than 305 horsepower / 300 lb-ft torque. Finally, the new 2.7L V6 EcoBoost engine with Auto Start-Stop has been developed for the new F-150 and will deliver the same power as a mid-range V8 and better fuel economy. We also offer six electrified vehicles—delivering the power of choice for leading fuel economy across our lineup—the Focus Electric, C-MAX Hybrid, C-MAX Energi, Fusion Hybrid, Fusion Energi, and Lincoln MKZ Hybrid. Our share of the U.S. electrified vehicle market more than doubled in 2013—up approximately 9 percentage points to 15.3 percent for 2013, compared with 2012. The increase contributed to our 0.5 percentage point increase in overall U.S. market share in 2013, the biggest gain of any full-line automaker. Our sustainability strategy also identifies opportunities to use recycled or renewable material while enabling markets for end-of-life vehicle recycling. We are committed to increasing the use of recycled and renewable content in our vehicles. In support of our product development strategy, our material engineers are developing standardized specifications for sustainable materials and working with the recycling industry and our supply base to reduce the environmental impact of components. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 38 Safe. Vehicle safety is a critical part of our brand promise to Go Further. We are specifically committed to designing and manufacturing vehicles that achieve high levels of performance in real-world safety and meet or exceed all regulatory requirements for safety. Ford remains among the leaders in vehicle safety, earning a total of 91 “Top Safety Picks” from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (“IIHS”)—more than any other manufacturer in the eight-year history of that crash testing program. For the 2013 model year, 13 of our vehicles earned Top Safety Picks from IIHS. We aim to give customers peace of mind and make the world safer by developing advanced safety technologies and making them available across a wide range of vehicles. Our available rear-seat inflatable safety belts, launched on the 2011 Ford Explorer, are an automotive industry exclusive and have won numerous awards. In the 2013 model year, we expanded the availability of these safety belts in North America to the Ford Flex and the Lincoln MKT and MKZ. The Lane Keeping System, a driver assist feature, was launched in 2011 in Europe on the Ford Focus. Its availability has been expanded to North America on the 2013 Lincoln MKS, MKT, and MKZ and the Ford Explorer and Fusion. For the 2013 model year, we expanded the availability of Curve Control, a driver assist technology that helps slow the vehicle when it senses the driver is taking a curve too quickly. In North America, Curve Control is now offered on the Ford Explorer, Taurus, Flex, and Escape, as well as the Lincoln MKS and MKT. In Europe, it is available on the Ford Kuga. Driver behavior is a key contributing factor in many vehicle crashes. We have developed an array of programs and technologies that help to encourage safer behavior on the roadways, for both experienced and novice drivers. The Ford Driving Skills for Life (“Ford DSFL”), our flagship driver-education program, demonstrates our commitment to help new drivers to improve their motoring skills. In the United States, Ford DSFL focuses on teen drivers; in our Asia Pacific Africa markets, the program is aimed at novice drivers of all ages. Smart. Ford continues to build upon its technology leadership by launching new features that make customers’ lives easier and their driving experience safer and more enjoyable. Examples of recently launched features include Emergency Assistance, Active City Stop, Active Park Assist, Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keeping Assist, Traffic Sign Recognition, Door Edge Protector, Enhanced Traffic Message Channel, Hands-Free Liftgate, and Multi-Contour Seats. Other exciting concepts are under development—features that our customers see and appreciate, and make their driving experience safer and more enjoyable. Ford set the benchmark for in-car connectivity systems with SYNC and we are now building on that success. We have produced more than 10 million vehicles that are equipped with SYNC, and we expect the total to increase to more than 14 million by 2015 as we launch SYNC globally. We are taking an agnostic approach to in-car connectivity which has three components: built-in, brought-in, and beamed-in to enable and enhance the customer’s digital lifestyle. Ford’s newly established connectivity organization will focus on creating a seamless customer experience both inside and outside the vehicle. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) General Our vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln. In 2013, we sold approximately 6,330,000 vehicles at wholesale throughout the world. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“Item 7”) for discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes. Substantially all of our vehicles, parts, and accessories are marketed through distributors and dealers (collectively, “dealerships”), the substantial majority of which are independently owned. At December 31, 2013, the approximate number of dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows: Brand Number of Dealerships at December 31, 2013 Ford 10,707 Ford-Lincoln (combined) 880 Lincoln 185 Total 11,772 We do not depend on any single customer or small group of customers to the extent that the loss of such customer or group of customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale, we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to fleet customers, including commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments. We also sell parts and accessories, primarily to our dealerships (which in turn sell these products to retail customers) and to authorized parts distributors (which in turn primarily sell these products to retailers). Through our dealerships, we also offer extended service contracts to retail customers. The worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic conditions, among other factors, over which we have little control. This is especially so because vehicles are durable goods, which provide consumers latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing vehicle. The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth, geopolitical events, and other factors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars and trucks and the availability and cost of financing and fuel). As we recently have seen in the United States and Europe, in particular, the number of cars and trucks sold may vary substantially from year to year. Further, the automotive industry is a highly competitive business that has a wide and growing variety of product offerings from a growing number of manufacturers. Our wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand. In the short term, our wholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory. Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety, fuel efficiency, functionality, and reputation. Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions. Our ability to satisfy changing consumer preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance characteristics, affects our sales and earnings significantly. As with other manufacturers, the profitability of our business is affected by many factors, including: • Wholesale unit volumes • Margin of profit on each vehicle sold - which in turn is affected by many factors, such as: Market factors - volume and mix of vehicles and options sold, and net pricing (reflecting, among other factors, incentive programs) Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions Costs for safety, emissions, and fuel economy technology and equipment • A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly affect overall profitability ITEM 1. Business (Continued) 4 Our industry has a very competitive pricing environment, driven in part by industry excess capacity, particularly in mature markets such as North America and Europe. The decline in the value of the yen during the past two years also has contributed significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets. For the past several decades, manufacturers typically have given price discounts and other marketing incentives to maintain market share and production levels. A discussion of our strategies to compete in this pricing environment is set forth in the “Overview” section in Item 7. Competitive Position. The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single dominant producer. Certain manufacturers, however, account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries, especially their countries of origin. Key competitors with global presence include Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, General Motors Company, Honda Motor Company, Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault-Nissan B.V., Suzuki Motor Corporation, Toyota Motor Corporation, and Volkswagen AG Group. Seasonality. We generally record the sale of a vehicle (and recognize revenue) when it is produced and shipped or delivered to our customer (i.e., the dealership). See the “Overview” section in Item 7 for additional discussion of revenue recognition practices. We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors, including retail sales (i.e., units sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail) and dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in inventory by our dealerships for sale to their customers). Historically, we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business, with production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer (typically the strongest sales months of the year). Raw Materials. We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in production of our vehicles. These materials include base metals (e.g., steel, iron castings, and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene). We believe we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs. There always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials, however, which could impact availability in sufficient quantities to meet our needs. See the “Overview” section of Item 7 for a discussion of commodity and energy price trends, and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” (“Item 7A”) for a discussion of commodity price risks. Backlog Orders. We generally produce and ship our products on average within approximately 20 days after an order is deemed to become firm. Therefore, no significant amount of backlog orders accumulates during any period. Intellectual Property. We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, copyrights, and trademarks on a global basis. Our policy is to protect our competitive position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and international patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We have generated a large number of patents, and expect this portfolio to continue to grow as we actively pursue additional technological innovation. We currently have approximately 24,400 active patents and pending patent applications globally, with an average age for patents in our active patent portfolio of just under five and a half years. In addition to this intellectual property, we also rely on our proprietary knowledge and ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Although we believe these patents, patent applications, and know-how, in the aggregate, are important to the conduct of our business, and we obtain licenses to use certain intellectual property owned by others, none is individually considered material to our business. We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its products and services globally. Certain of these marks are integral to the conduct of our business, a loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Warranty Coverage and Additional Service Actions. We currently provide warranties on vehicles we sell. Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage, and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. In compliance with regulatory requirements, we also provide emissions-defects and emissionsperformance warranty coverage. Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust all parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period. In addition to the costs associated with this warranty coverage provided on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of additional service actions, including product recalls and customer satisfaction actions. For additional information regarding warranty and related costs, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 and Note 29 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. ITEM 1. Business (Continued) 5 Industry Sales Volume Industry sales volume is an internal estimate based on publicly-available data collected from various government, private, and public sources around the globe. The following chart shows industry sales volume for the last five years for certain key markets in each region, and for the total we track within each of our North America, South America, Europe, and Asia Pacific Africa regions (in millions of units): Industry Sales Volume (a) 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 United States 15.9 14.8 13.0 11.8 10.6 Canada 1.8 1.7 1.6 1.6 1.5 Mexico 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.8 North America 18.8 17.5 15.5 14.2 12.9 Brazil 3.8 3.8 3.6 3.5 3.1 Argentina 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.7 0.5 South America (b) 5.6 5.6 5.4 5.0 4.2 Britain 2.6 2.3 2.2 2.3 2.2 Germany 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.2 4.0 Europe (c) 13.7 14.0 15.3 15.3 15.9 Turkey 0.9 0.8 0.9 0.8 0.6 Russia 2.8 3.0 2.7 2.0 1.5 China 22.2 19.0 18.5 18.2 14.0 India 3.3 3.6 3.3 3.1 2.3 Australia 1.1 1.1 1.0 1.0 0.9 South Africa 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.4 ASEAN (d) 2.8 2.8 2.0 1.9 1.3 Asia Pacific Africa (e) 35.9 32.8 30.0 30.0 23.9 ______________ (a) Throughout this Report, industry sales volume and wholesale unit volumes include sales of medium and heavy trucks. (b) South America industry sales volume and market share are based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations for the six markets we track in the region (i.e., Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela). (c) Europe industry sales volume and market share are based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations for the 19 markets we track (i.e., Austria, Belgium, Britain, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland); sales of Ford brand vehicles in Turkey and Russia by our unconsolidated affiliates Ford Otomotiv Sanayi Anonim Sirketi (“Ford Otosan”) and Ford Sollers Netherlands B.V. (“FordSollers”), respectively, contribute to Europe's wholesale unit volumes, but are not reflected in industry sales volume or market share for the region. (d) ASEAN includes Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. (e) Asia Pacific Africa industry sales volume and market share are based, in part, on estimated vehicle sales for the 11 markets we track (i.e., Australia, China, Japan, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam). ITEM 1. Business (Continued) 6 North America The following tables show our wholesales and share by market in North America: Wholesales (a) (b) (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 United States 2,608 2,302 2,224 1,947 1,563 Canada 283 281 273 278 223 Mexico 91 83 88 88 80 North America 3,088 2,784 2,686 2,413 1,927 ______________ (a) Throughout this Report, wholesale unit volumes include all Ford badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate), units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers and units distributed for other manufacturers, and JMC brand vehicles produced by our unconsolidated Chinese joint venture Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. (“JMC”). Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, and JMC brand vehicles produced by our unconsolidated affiliate) are not included in our revenue. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option, as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), are included in wholesale unit volumes. (b) Throughout this Report, regional wholesale unit volumes generally include direct exports to dealerships in export markets outside the region. Market Share (a) 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 United States 15.7% 15.2% 16.5% 16.4% 15.3% Canada 15.9 16.1 17.1 16.9 15.2 Mexico 8.0 8.2 9.4 10.5 11.8 ______________ (a) Throughout this Report, market share represents reported retail sales of our brands as a percent of total industry sales volume in the relevant market or region (as opposed to wholesale unit volumes reflecting sales directly by us to our customers, generally our dealers). United States. The competitive environment in the United States remains intense. In 2013, our market share was up 0.5 percentage points to 15.7% of the industry. Many of the import brand automakers have plans to increase production capacity in North America in the near-term, as competitive pressures mount. The small car segment has increased its share from 14% in 2004 to approximately 20% in 2013. We expect small cars to plateau, with a slower rate of growth going forward. Overall, small cars were up 5% in 2013, relative to an industry that was up 7%. The mid-size car segment grew at just 1% in 2013, relative to an industry that was up 7%. The mid-size car segment represented about 16% of the overall industry. The segment has been stable over the past decade, with the segment ranging from a low of 14% to a high of 17% of the industry. The all-new Fusion was a success for us in 2013 as we sold 295,280 vehicles, with sales increasing 22% compared with 2012. The small car-based utility segment grew 16% in 2013, more than twice the rate of the overall industry. The small utility segment now represents 14% of the U.S. auto industry, its highest percent of industry ever. We expect the small utility segment will continue to grow and out-pace the overall industry for a number of years. This is due to the appeal of the segment with the growing number of baby-boomers crossing into empty nester status. Our Escape small utility produced another record sales year in 2013, with 295,993 vehicles sold—a 13 percent increase over 2012. In 2013, Ford was the number-one selling brand of utilities in America for the third straight year. The full-size pickup segment represented 12% of the overall industry in 2013, an increase from 11.5% in 2012. Given continued improvements in new home construction and the overall average age of the truck fleet of approximately 11 years, we believe the segment can continue to support growth in the short to medium-term. Our F-Series sales totaled 763,402 vehicles in 2013. This represents an 18% increase over 2012 and our 37th year as America’s best-selling pickup and our 32nd straight year as America’s best-selling vehicle (car, truck, or utility). F-Series market share was 40% of the full-size pickup segment in 2013, which represented our best share of the segment since 2000. Our strong U.S. vehicle sales in 2013 reflected our balanced portfolio of fuel-efficient vehicles, as our passenger cars, utilities, and trucks each reported gains last year. Cars were up 10%, utilities posted a 9% gain, and trucks expanded 13%. Retail sales across the country were up 14% in 2013. Our strongest retail sales growth is coming from areas where historically our sales have been lower relative to our traditionally strong Great Lakes and Central regions of the country. ITEM 1. Business (Continued) 7 We posted our strongest retail sales growth of 21% year-over-year in the West, and had retail sales growth of 17% in the South East. Fleet sales include sales to commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments. In 2013, fleet sales were 28% of our total sales, compared with 30% in 2012. The majority of the fleet sales were with commercial and government customers, which are more profitable than daily rentals. In 2013, our daily rental sales were 11% of total sales, down from 12% in 2012. Canada. Industry sales volume in Canada grew 4% in 2013. Within that total, car sales decreased by 1.7 percentage points to 44% of overall industry sales volume, utilities increased by 1.3 percentage points to 35% of overall industry sales volume, and truck sales increased by 0.4 percentage points to 21% of industry sales volume. Our sales performance in the market earned Ford the sales leadership title in Canada for the fourth year in a row. In 2013, Ford earned segment leadership with Fusion, Mustang, Escape, Explorer, F-150, and Super Duty. F-Series maintained truck leadership for the 48th straight year, achieving record sales of more than 122,000 units. Mexico. Industry sales volume in Mexico grew 7% during 2013. The favorable sales performance of our Ikon and Fiesta in the B-car segment, along with favorable performance of the EcoSport and Escape, impacted our market share. The main contributors to market share decline were the discontinuation of Courier and delays in the introduction of the Ranger. South America We track industry sales and market share for six markets in South America—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Brazil and Argentina are our highest-volume South American markets. In particular, Brazil’s economy and demographics, with growing per capita income, low vehicle ownership rates, and a young population, have allowed its automotive market to more than double since 2002. These favorable factors are expected to continue to contribute to growth in vehicle sales in Brazil. The following tables show our wholesales and market share in the largest markets and in total: Wholesales (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Brazil 364 336 346 358 336 Argentina 118 107 105 85 66 South America 538 498 506 489 443 Market Share 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Brazil 9.4% 9.1% 9.5% 10.4% 10.3% Argentina 12.6 12.3 12.9 12.4 13.3 South America 9.3 9.0 9.3 9.8 10.2 The competition in Brazil continues to intensify, as a number of automotive manufacturers bring substantial capacity increases to the market. The intensifying competitive environment is putting pressure on industry net pricing. In 2013, we continued to leverage our One Ford plan by introducing global products (e.g., Focus), with additional global products to come that will continue to benefit us in this market. The competitive environment and a volatile economic outlook with new trade barriers and currency risks across the region, especially in Venezuela and Argentina, may limit our growth in certain countries. Europe The automotive industry in Europe is intensely competitive, and expected to intensify further as Japanese and Korean manufacturers increase production capacity in the region and manufacturers of premium brands (e.g., BMW, MercedesBenz and Audi) continue to broaden product offerings. The nearly two percent decline in industry sales volume for the traditional 19 markets we tracked in Europe in 2013 compared with 2012 largely reflects the impact of the Eurozone crisis, which largely affected the first half of 2013 and showed recovery in the second half of the year. ITEM 1.

Our continued market strength reflects the strong momentum of our new or refreshed vehicles, including the B-MAX, Fiesta, Kuga, Tourneo Custom, and Transit Custom. Within the 19 markets, Britain and Germany are our highest-volume markets. Any change in the British or German market has a significant effect on the results of Europe. The following tables show our wholesales and market share for Britain and Germany (which are included within the traditional 19 markets data above): Wholesales (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Britain 379 337 342 341 354 Germany 227 208 250 216 286 Market Share 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Britain 14.7% 14.9% 15.0% 15.0% 16.7% Germany 6.9 6.8 7.4 6.9 7.6 Britain. Industry in Britain began to decline in 2008 with the global financial crisis, and between 2009 and 2012 remained in the 2.2 million–2.3 million unit range (compared with 2.8 million units in 2007). In 2013, industry sales volume, at 2.6 million, increased 11% compared with 2012, reflecting a higher demand from private customers. The retail channel industry increased 16% in 2013 compared with 2012. Our market share decreased slightly in 2013 compared with 2012, reflecting our reduced participation in low-margin business such as daily rental and demonstration vehicles. We continued to be the market share leader in Britain for total, passenger, and commercial vehicles. Germany. With 3.3 million new vehicle registrations in 2013, Germany’s industry sales volume declined 4% compared with the prior year, reflecting declines in both retail and fleet industry—retail industry decreased 5% and fleet 6%. Germany remains the largest vehicle market in the European Union. Despite our reduced participation in low-margin business such as daily rental and demonstration vehicles, our market share in 2013 increased compared with 2012, driven by a strong share of the retail segment and growth in commercial vehicles.

Business (Continued) 9 Turkey. Industry growth slowed in 2008 as a result of the global financial crisis. Beginning in 2009, industry vehicle sales accelerated due to government incentives put in place, with significant continuous increase in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, industry decreased by about 10% compared with the prior year, driven by increased taxes. Industry in 2013, at 0.9 million units, increased 9% compared with the prior year reflecting the availability of favorable automotive financing and a competitive pricing environment that more than offset the Euro/Turkish Lira exchange increase. Our market share declined compared with prior year reflecting competitive market pressures and a segment shift from commercial vehicles to cars, although Ford remains the leading automotive company for the 12th consecutive year. Russia. Following a 50% contraction in 2009 as a result of the impact of the global financial crisis reaching Russia, industry sales volume has returned almost to pre-crisis levels, with industry sales volume of 2.8 million units in 2013. Russia is the second-largest market for vehicle sales in Europe, and is expected to become the largest over the next several years. Our market share decline was largely driven by industry growth in SUV segments, where we are not yet fully participating and capacity constraints that prevented us from following the growth. Asia Pacific Africa Asia Pacific Africa industry sales and market share data reflect our 11 major markets in the region. Of the markets we track in this region, ASEAN, Australia, China, India, and South Africa are our principal markets. Small cars account for 57% of Asia Pacific Africa industry sales volume, and are anticipated to continue to benefit from government policy. We anticipate that the ongoing relaxation of import restrictions (including duty reductions) will continue to intensify competition in the region, particularly around small, ultra-affordable passenger cars. The highly successful launches of our all-new Kuga and EcoSport small utilities in 2013 once again demonstrate our ability to successfully compete in key growth segments in the region.

China and India are burgeoning markets that are expected to continue to experience rapid and substantial growth in the next ten years, driving new economic growth in the region. Accordingly, we have increased and are planning to increase further our dealer networks and manufacturing capacity in the region. We and our unconsolidated joint venture affiliates opened two new plants in the region in 2013, and currently are building six additional plants in the region—four in China and two in India—all as part of our plan to reach production capacity of 2.7 million vehicles by mid-decade. These new state-of-the-art highly-flexible manufacturing facilities will help us reach the goal of increasing worldwide sales to about 8 million vehicles per year by mid-decade. 
Research and development play a vital role for the BMW Group, given its broad range of products and the high number of new models. Our vehicles and services also set standards in terms of connecting car occupants with the outside world. During 2013, a total of 11,359 employees were engaged throughout the BMW Group’s global research and innovation network at twelve locations spread over five countries, to deliver the best product quality possible and develop innova- tive technologies for customers. Further information on our research and development activities is provided in the relevant section of the Report on Economic Position. 
Research and development expenditure for the year rose by 21.3 % to € 4,792 million, mostly for projects aimed at securing the Group’s future business (2012: € 3,952 million). The research and development ratio was 6.3 %, 1.2 percentage points higher than in the previous year (2012: 5.1 %). 
The ratio of capitalised development costs to total re- search and development costs for the period (capitali- sation ratio) was 36.4 % (2012: 27.6 %). Amortisation of capitalised development costs totalled € 1,069 million (2012: € 1,130 million). Further information on research and development expenditure is provided in the section Results of Operations, Financial Position and Net Assets and in note 10 to the Group Financial Statements. 
As one of the most innovative companies in the auto- mobile industry, suppliers and external providers are also highly involved in our research and development activities. Close collaboration with the parties concerned enables us to offer our customers new technologies more quickly and underscores our aspiration to be inno- vation leader in the sector. It also helps us to ensure that important project-related technological expertise remains within the BMW Group. 
Fleet carbon emissions2, 3
The BMW Group is continually reducing fleet carbon emissions by making its drivetrain systems more effi- cient and increasing the scope of electrification, while still setting standards in terms of sporting flair and dynamic driving pleasure.
The volume of carbon emissions produced by our vehi- cle fleet sold in Europe3 continued to fall thanks to the rigorous deployment of our Efficient Dynamics tech- nologies, and amounted to 133 g CO / km (2012: 138 g
CO2 / km; – 3.6 %).Efficient Dynamics
The vehicles produced by the BMW Group feature in- telligent lightweight design, optimised aerodynamic characteristics and efficient engines. The well-thought- out mixture of materials used to build our vehicles enables us to continually reduce their weight. The BMW Group is also one of the world’s leaders in the use of CFRP in car production. The lightweight material is at least as strong, but up to 50 % lighter than steel and around 30 % lighter than aluminium. When combined with an aluminium chassis, a thermoplastic outer skin and comprehensive weight optimisation in many other components, the CFRP passenger compartment used in the BMW i3 is currently the most effective implementation of intelligent lightweight carmaking on the market.
As from 2014, a completely new family of engines fea- turing BMW TwinPower turbo technology will power the first BMW and MINI models with new 3-, 4- and 6-cylinder in-line engines, ensuring that the best pos- sible Efficient Dynamics technology is available in all segments and performance categories.
The EU6 emission standard, which is mandatory for all newly registered automobiles as from autumn 2014, has already been met for most new BMW and MINI models since 2013. BMW Blue Performance technology ensures that the reduction in the percentage of nitrogen oxide in emissions required by the EU6 standard has been ful- filled for BMW’s diesel models.
In the field of electromobility, too, the BMW Group is relying on in-house developments for its drive systems. BMW eDrive embraces all of the drive system compo- nents required for fully electric driving, i.e. the electric motor, power electronics, e-transmission and high- voltage battery system.
Intelligent energy management ensures that the waste heat generated by the drive system is reduced; kinetic energy is produced as needed and recovered. The BMW Group has done pioneering work in the field of recu- peration technology, which it has gradually been intro- ducing since 2007. The technology generates electrical energy that is fed into the vehicle’s electrical system during acceleration and braking phases.
The BMW i3
The fully electrically powered BMW i3 was launched in 2013 and is the first electric car on the market to com- bine the pleasure of driving so typical for BMW with
electromobility suitable for daily use. It is based on an innovative vehicle concept, which is tailor-made for electromobility and includes a passenger compartment made of CFRP. Driver assistance systems and mobility services from BMW ConnectedDrive as well as the services of 360° ELECTRIC have been specially developed for the BMW i Series. The BMW i3 uniquely combines dynamic driving (from 0 to 100 km / h in 7.2 seconds) with low electricity consumption (12.9 kWh in the EU test cycle). It is powered by a lithium-ion battery spe- cially developed and produced by the BMW Group, which is integrated in the underbody to save space. The energy storage capacity gives the car a range of 130 to 160 kilometres under everyday driving conditions.
Connected mobility
With the new orientation of BMW ConnectedDrive ser- vices, BMW continues to extend its outstanding posi- tion as leading provider worldwide of online-based ser- vices for vehicles. BMW ConnectedDrive is based on two key areas, namely driver assistance systems (con- venience and safety functions) and services (infotain- ment and mobility services). Customers can now order mobility services on an individual basis. Moreover, in- dividual services can be ordered for limited periods of time. The individualisation of services is now also avail- able for the first time for a used BMW. As a result, both BMW and BMW i customers can benefit from a broad range of services and far lower entry prices. Since July 2013, many BMW models have been equipped with an integrated SIM card as standard. The aim is, by 2017, to connect around five million BMW vehicles worldwide via Connected Drive by means of the permanently in- stalled SIM card.
In future it will be possible to order BMW Connected- Drive services in the newly created BMW Connected- Drive store, an option unique for the market. The store is not only available online, but also when travelling, via the vehicle’s on-board system.
With its intelligent emergency call feature, BMW already offers a broader range of functions than that required by EU legislation for 2015. Automatic position-finding and accident severity detection also help to greatly minimise the time between an accident occurring and the arrival of medical and rescue teams. In future, the intelligent emergency call will be offered as standard in practically all markets and models.
The range of optional driver assistance systems has also been considerably expanded for the new MINI.

Available for the first time are a head-up display above the steering column, the Driving Assistant system in- cluding camera-based, active speed control, collision and pedestrian warning, high beam assistant and traffic sign detection as well as a parking assistant and a re- versing camera.
The diversity of the MINI Connected infotainment pro- gramme, which is unique in its competitive environ- ment, has been additionally increased. The new MINI is the first vehicle in its segment that can be perma- nently equipped with a SIM card, which means it has the emergency call service with automatic position- finding and accident severity detection as well as the MINI teleservices at its disposal. The social networks and infotainment functions, which can be integrated in the vehicle via apps, are now available both for Apple iPhones and for smartphones running the Android operating system.
With functions such as traffic sign recognition and colli- sion warning technology, BMW Motorrad Connected- Ride is bringing camera-based rider assistance systems that are already standard features in BMW cars to the world of motorcycling. The particular challenge in this case is how to implement the functions to suit motor- cycling conditions: the system still needs to work per- fectly when leaning into corners and in all weathers. For example, based on ultrasound technology, the Side View Assist system warns the motorcycle rider of ob- jects located in blind spots and vehicles approaching from the sides by means of orange warning triangles built into the base of the motorcycle’s mirrors.
For a number of years now, the BMW Group has been working on an electronic co-pilot that provides vehicles with highly automated driving capabilities on motor- ways. As early as 2011, a trial vehicle drove from Munich to Nuremburg without assistance from the driver. A highly automated switching from one motorway to an- other at motorway intersections is now also possible, thus managing a further key step in the automated ne- gotiation of motorway networks.
After four years of research work, in 2013 one of the largest field trials worldwide for Car-to-X-Communica- tion simTD (Safe Intelligent Mobility – test field Ger- many), involving more than 120 cars, was completed. Numerous companies in the automotive and commu- nications industries as well as research institutes joined forces to test the electronic connectedness of vehicles and traffic infrastructure. The BMW Group concentrated
particularly on the cross-traffic assistant and the traffic sign assistant. Via radio signals, the cross-traffic assis- tant registers the data of all road users at any given crossing and, with the help of positioning technology that is already available as standard equipment, can manage to avoid many of the accidents that typically occur at crossings. The second main focus was on
the traffic sign assistant, which, alongside a host of other features, informs the driver of current speed limits in traffic guidance systems or of approaching congestion.
Awards for technological innovation and design
Engines newly developed by the BMW Group were awarded two category prizes at the international “Engine of the Year Awards 2013”. An international jury awarded first prize in its capacity class to the 2.0-litre 4-cylinder TwinPower turbo engine, which powers vehicles such as the BMW 1, 3 and 5 Series models. In its class, the 1.6-litre 4-cylinder MINI Twin- Power turbo engine, which powers the MINI Cooper S, recorded its seventh consecutive award win. The suc- cess is further proof of the dominance of the BMW Group with its globally recognised competence in engine development. No other car manufacturer has managed to gain more titles at the Engine of the Year Awards in recent years.
The BMW Group celebrated dual success at the inter- nationally acclaimed “Goldenes Lenkrad” automotive awards. The BMW X5 was voted the most convincing new model of the year in the SUV category – as the first BMW model in this category. In the competition for the “Grünes Lenkrad”, the BMW i3 won hands down against all other brands. The BMW i3 also secured first place in the German Design Award 2014 in the “Trans- portation and Public Space” category. An international jury of experts presented awards not only for the BMW i3, but also for the concept study BMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coupé and the BMW R 1200 GS. A total of six models designed by the BMW Group were honoured at the world’s oldest and widely respected “GOOD DESIGNTM” awards. The independent jury awarded prizes to numerous vehicles, including the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupé, the BMW 3 Series Sedan, the BMW M6 Coupé, the BMW M5 and the MINI Roadster. The BMW Group also celebrated receiving four prizes at the red dot award: product design 2013. In the “Automotive and Transport” category the BMW M6 Gran Coupé, the BMW M135i, the BMW 3 Series Touring and the BMW
R 1200 GS were each awarded the red dot design award for their high-quality design.

puRChasing and supplieR netwoRk
As the leading provider of premium vehicles, the BMW Group operates the supply chain together with its part- ners. The focus here is on achieving the right balance between quality, innovation, flexible supply structures and competitive costs. This enables us, even in a volatile environment, to react swiftly and flexibly to fluctua- tions in demand and to continue improving the quality of our products and services.
Numerous model start-ups
The year under report saw the launch of ten models in total for the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands, for which much of the groundwork was performed by the purchasing team. The BMW i3 incorporates a large number of innovations, implemented thanks to the co- ordinated efforts of our suppliers and our own in-house component manufacturing resources. Furthermore, the new generation of the MINI marks the start of front- wheel drive architecture for the BMW Group.
Internationalisation of procurement markets
In accordance with the basic principle applied that pro- duction follows the market, the BMW Group is increas- ingly shifting value-added processes into its respective sales markets, thus providing a further defence against currency exposures.
High level of investment safeguards productivity and technology lead
The BMW Group’s Purchasing and Supplier team is also responsible for component production sites and carries out regular comparative analyses to ensure the efficiency of our in-house component production facilities. The expansion of the Landshut production plant for carbon fibre parts emphasises the importance that the BMW Group attaches to it as a competence centre for light- weight construction and electromobility. This invest- ment in CFRP technology provides the basis for the large- scale automated series production of carbon fibre parts in the BMW Group.The revised BMW Z4 model was introduced in March 2013. This was followed in June by the launch of the new M6 Gran Coupé, which offers the perfect balance between design, performance and luxury. The new BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo, as the third body variant of this series, came onto the market in June 2013. It combines the Sedan’s sporty, dynamic design with the Touring’s functionality and versatility. The BMW 5 Se- ries revised model has been available in the showrooms since July. In addition to design modifications, a wider selection of engines and additions to its broad choice of features, the new BMW 5 Series offers a more exten- sive range of standard equipment. October saw the market launch of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé. With its low centre of gravity and powerful engine models, the sporty Coupé sets new standards for driving dy- namics in its segment. The third generation of the BMW X5 reached the showrooms in November. The dis- tinguishing features of this successful model are its increased sporting ability and lower fuel consumption.
In April 2013, the BMW Group, together with its joint venture partner Brilliance Automotive, announced the launch of an electric vehicle developed specially for China under the brand name ZINORO.
Successful market launch of the BMW i3
At the end of July 2013, the BMW i3 was presented to the public in three cities simultaneously: London, New York and Beijing. The European sales launch of the BMW i3 in November 2013 was accompanied by an ex- tensive communication campaign. First successes have already been recorded: the numbers of interested parties, test drive enquiries and orders for the BMW premium electric vehicle are surpassing expectations.
The BMW i3 is available directly from 196 European dealerships with BMW i agency agreements (BMW i agents). In selected markets, the sales concept for the BMW i has been extended to include purchase offers by telephone and via the Internet. In addition, BMW i product experts advise interested customers at the BMW i agencies. The coming months will see the launch
of the BMW i3 in the USA, China and Japan, among other countries.
MINI extends model range
In March 2013, the MINI Paceman became the seventh model in the MINI brand range. It is the first Sports Activity Coupé in the premium compact segment. The brand is therefore continuing to extend its model range to include new vehicle concepts. April saw the market launch of the John Cooper Works brand in China. In Shanghai, MINI opened the first Experience Centre for the brand in China.
In November, the BMW Group announced the third generation of the MINI, which will be available on mar- kets worldwide in spring 2014. The new MINI redefines the premium small-car segment and offers numerous innovations.
Rolls-Royce Wraith extends the brand experience
In 2013, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars presented the Wraith, the most potent Rolls-Royce of all time. The Wraith stands out for its unique design and has been available in showrooms since September 2013. The Wraith has received the highest accolades, both in the media and from customers. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars also expanded its global presence in the year under report to include Turkey, the Philippines and Taiwan.

are designed to fulfil our customers’ desire for con- venience. BMW i3 Navigation includes a dynamic range assistant, which provides the customer with reliable information on the location of charging stations along the route or suggests efficient driving styles. The Assis- tance Services package comprises BMW i Connected- Drive functions for smartphone and navigation, which support the driver when charging the vehicle and during the journey. The service package can also include pub- lic transport options in the mobility planning. With a BMW i, the customer is also entitled to the comprehen- sive BMW i Mobile Care package. This includes tele- phone assistance, on-the-spot help and a replacement vehicle if required. As part of the holistic approach of 360°ELECTRIC, a customised maintenance and repair package is also offered in addition.conomic success, the responsible use of resources and the assumption of our social responsibilities are the cornerstones for long-term growth and a continual rise in the value of the business. For this reason, due con- sideration to ecological and social criteria along the entire value-added chain and a clear commitment to the preservation of resources are values that are firmly em- bedded in the philosophy of the BMW Group.
Again in 2013, the Group successfully maintained its leading position among the most sustainable carmakers worldwide – a fact borne out by the top places achieved in prestigious ratings. The BMW share was again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI, Europe and World), making the BMW Group the only carmaker to be consecutively listed in the top three for the last 15 years. In the Global 500 Rating of the Carbon Dis- closure Project (CDP), in 2013 we achieved our best re- sult of all time and with 100 out of 100 possible disclo- sure points and a performance assessment in the best ‘A’ ranking, making us leaders in our sector. More- over, the BMW Group was again included in the British FTSE4Good Index in 2013.
Clean production
The integration of environmental management in all production processes enables us to minimise our use of resources and cushion their environmental impact. Since 2006 we have reduced both the resources utilised and the emissions per vehicle produced by an average of 41.4 %.
In 2013, the utilisation of resources and the emissions per vehicle produced were again reduced by an average of 6.6 % compared with the previous year, thus giving rise to savings of €6.8 million.
Despite extensive in-house production (e. g. CFRP manu- facturing) and the construction / commissioning of new structures worldwide (such as the new foundry at the Landshut plant), we managed to further reduce the energy consumption per vehicle produced to 2.36 MWh or 2.1 %. Improved energy efficiency, the utilisation of highly efficient, ecologically sustainable combined heat and power plants (CHPs) and the use of electricity generated from renewable sources enabled us to reduce the carbon emissions per vehicle produced by 5.6 % to 0.68 tons during the period under report.
In order to generate sufficient energy at its various pro- duction plants, the BMW Group makes good use of its own combined heat and power plants. The calculation of energy efficiency within the BMW Group’s produc- tion network has been adjusted to allow for increased consumption caused by conversion due to the growing use of CHP plants. The previous year’s figures have been adjusted accordingly.
The volume of water required per vehicle produced also fell to 2.18 m3 (– 1.8 %) in 2013. The amount of process wastewater produced decreased by 7.8 % to 0.47 m3 per vehicle produced. Measures implemented due to the continual improvement process and good capacity utili- sation at our plants contributed towards improved efficiency in the use of both energy and water. At the Spartanburg plant in the USA in particular, water con- sumption was lowered by the use of condensed water gained from the cooling system.
The amount of non-recyclable production waste fell significantly by 11.4 % to 5.73 kg per vehicle produced in 2013. A strong contributing factor was the decrease in non-recyclable waste by almost one-quarter (23.3 %) at the Landshut plant.
Solvent emissions were reduced by an impressive 10.7 % to 1.59 kg per vehicle produced during the period un- der report, an achievement primarily due to the retrofit- ting of the paint shop to include an exhaust air filtering system at the Dadong2 plant in China.
1 Including BMW Brilliance joint venture. 2 Joint venture BMW Brilliance.Sustainability in the value-added chain
Sustainability criteria also play a major role in the field of transport logistics as well as in the selection and as- sessment of our suppliers. Sustainability requirements apply not only to our suppliers, but also to our transpor- tation service providers. The amount of energy needed for transportation purposes has considerably increased in recent years. In order to keep carbon emissions to an absolute minimum, we work on the principle “produc- tion follows the market”. In addition, we are working on improving our packaging and continually increasing the percentage of low-carbon types of transportation. In total, 60.7 % of all new cars left our plants by rail during the twelve-month period under report. Moreover, in 2013 we introduced measures to reduce the volume of goods transported by airfreight.
Carbon emissions reduced across the fleet
The Efficient Dynamics technology package has been helping us reduce the amount of CO2 our vehicles emit for many years. The 100 % electrically powered BMW i3

was added to the BMW Group’s vehicle fleet in 2013. With increasing electrification, including that achieved by means of hybrid technology, we will continue to take a leading role in the lowering of carbon emissions and fuel consumption. Looking into the future, these technologies represent an important basis for fulfilling legally mandatory carbon and consumption limits.
The average carbon emissions of the vehicles we sold in Europe fell by 37 % from 1995 to 2013. The BMW Group’s fleet of new vehicles sold in Europe consumed an average of 4.8 litres of diesel per 100 km and 6.2 litres of petrol respectively. The average carbon emissions in our cars sold in Europe (EU 27) stood at 133 grams per kilometre during the year under report. We also lead the field among German premium-segment manufacturers with carbon emissions of 139 g / km. In 2013 the BMW Group’s fleet already included 39 models using less than 120 g CO2 / km. Our efficient technologies have given us a competitive edge, particularly in markets governed by a CO2-based vehicle tax.Further information on the subject of sustainability in the BMW Group is available in our online sustainability report at: www.bmwgroup.com /sustainability. The Sustainable Value Report 2012 was prepared in ac- cordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G3.1). At Level A+ (GRI-tested) it fulfils the highest degree of application laid down by GRI guidelines.18   Combined management RepoRt

ditions continue to exert an unsettling influence over both markets and consumers. Further risks arise from other potential economic developments, in particular a slowdown of economic momentum in China, one of the BMW Group’s principal markets, which could in turn result in lower demand for the products and services the Group offers. As in the previous year, the risk amounts attached to such an outcome are classified as high.
Any escalation of political conflicts and terrorist ac- tivities, natural disasters or possible pandemics could have a negative impact on the world economy and inter- national capital markets in general. The BMW Group counters these risks primarily by internationalising
its sales and production structures in order to reduce the potential impact of risk exposures in individual countries. The risk amounts attached to these risks are classified as low.
Overall, as in the previous year, the risk amounts at- tached to political and global economic risks are still classified as high.
Strategic and sector-specific risks
Innovation is the driving force behind the BMW Group’s success. The primary source of innovation is a world- wide global research and innovation network, in which employees work closely with one another to find to- day’s solutions for tomorrow’s mobility issues. At the same time, the technical challenges involved in reduc- ing fuel consumption and emission, are constantly on the rise. These requirements are accompanied by a whole swathe of rules that govern individual mobility in metropolitan areas.
New regulations and rising fuel and energy prices also exert an influence on customer behaviour. One sig- nificant risk for the car industry is the possibility that laws and regulations could be tightened at short notice, thus triggering the need for significantly higher levels of investment. In some cases, changes in customer be- haviour are not only brought on by new regulations, but also through changes of opinion, values and environmen- tal issues. Among other factors, global climate change
is having an effect on legislation, regulations and con- sumer behaviour. In order to meet structural changes in the demand for individual mobility that no longer necessarily means actually owning a vehicle, the BMW Group is offering corresponding mobility services, such as the DriveNow car sharing model.
With its Efficient Dynamics concept, the BMW Group is playing a pioneering role in the premium segment in reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. With effect from 2013, our range of products was expanded by the addition of electric powertrains in BMW i series vehicles. This strategy will also enable us to fulfil legal rules and requirements at the same time. The BMW Group is investing in the development of sustainable drive technologies and materials, with the aim of pro- viding highly efficient vehicles for individual mobility in the premium segment, both now and in the future.
The BMW Group is also committed to developing com- prehensive recycling concepts aimed at recycling mate- rials as efficiently as possible, closing material loops and conserving precious resources to the greatest possible extent. Statutory risks stemming from vehicle recycling are minimised by means of a specialised in-house team working in conjunction with regional managers.
Medium- and long-term targets have already been put in place in Europe, North America, Japan, China and other countries to minimise fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Europe has set a target of achieving an aver- age of 130 g CO2   /  km for all new vehicles by 2015. EU regulations set targets for CO2 emissions based on ve- hicle weight. For the BMW Group this means a target of under 140 g CO2   /  km per vehicle. The average for new car fleets in Europe has been set for 2020 at 95 g CO2   /  km. Fuel economy targets have now been fixed in the USA up to the year 2025. Beginning with a gradual reduction for 2012 models, the new car fleets of all manu- facturers are required to achieve an average emission value of 250 g CO2   / mile (155 g CO2   /  km) by model year 2016 and by 2025 an average value of 163 g CO2   / mile (101 g CO2   /  km). Japan has also announced ambitious targets for reducing fuel consumption. The regulations for individual vehicles and fleets have been implemented jointly in China. The debate on the successor regulation has already begun.
The broader market introduction of alternative drive systems presents new challenges and means additional investment for the automotive industry. At the same time the BMW Group also sees the changing situation as an ideal opportunity to put its technological expertise and innovative strengths to good use. Greater fuel economy and the reduction of emissions are fundamen- tal parameters that are automatically integrated in the design of new products.

In the short to medium term, the BMW Group is work- ing on achieving additional fuel economy by deploying a wide range of measures from the electrification of the drivetrain through to hybrid solutions. Solutions for sustainable mobility in densely populated areas are also in the process of being developed. Large-scale field trials with the MINI E have been carried out in the UK, Germany, France, the USA, China and Japan. A test fleet of BMW ActiveE electric cars based on the BMW 1 Se- ries Coupé has been on the road since 2011. The exten- sive knowledge gained from the trials will be used in the series development of the BMW Group’s electric cars. The BMW i3 came onto the market in 2013 as the first series-produced electric car made by the BMW Group and specially designed for the metropolitan regions of the world.
Similar to the statutory requirements being imposed on car manufacturers to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, the rules for car safety are also becoming continuously tougher, such as crash specifications in the USA. The specifications demanded of vehicles are chang- ing so comprehensively that there is no option but to develop new technologies to improve both active and passive safety systems. Active safety systems such as suspension regulation and driver assistance systems make an essential contribution to the prevention of ac- cidents, while passive safety systems help to reduce the consequences of accidents.
As in the previous financial year, the amounts of risk attached to strategic and sector-specific risks are classi- fied as low.
Operational risks
Production
Production stoppages and downtimes – in particular due to fire, but also those attributable to manufacturing equipment breakdowns, logistical disruptions or new vehicle production line start-ups – represent risks which the BMW Group counters with a broad range of appro- priate measures. Production structures and processes are designed from the outset with a view to reducing potential damage and the probability of occurrence. In addition to technical fire protection measures, the BMW Group has implemented an array of strategies, includ- ing preventative maintenance, spare parts management on a multi-site basis and back-up plans for alternative transportation. The level of risk is also reduced by the deployment of flexible work-schedule models and em-
ployee time accounts, but also by the ability to produce specific models at additional sites if necessary. More- over, risks arising from business interruption and loss of production as a consequence of fire or natural disaster are also insured up to economically reasonable levels with insurance companies of good credit standing.
The level of risk attached to production interruptions is classified as medium. There has been no change in this assessment compared to the previous year.
Purchasing
Close cooperation between carmakers and automotive suppliers generates economic benefits on the one hand, but also raises levels of dependency. The increasing trend towards modular-based production with a set of common architectures covering various models and product lines exacerbates the consequences of the loss of a supplier or failure to supply on time. As part of the supplier preselection process, the BMW Group is careful to ensure that its future business partners come up to the same high ecological, social and corporate governance standards by which the BMW Group is generally measured. Suppliers are assessed on the basis of the BMW Group Sustainability Standard which is applied throughout the worldwide supplier network. This set of fundamental principles and standards covers both production and non-production aspects relevant for the goods and services provided by suppliers, which also includes compliance with internationally recog- nised human rights and applicable labour and social standards. The principal tool for ensuring compliance with the BMW Group Sustainability Standard is a three- stage sustainability and risk management approach comprising a BMW Group-specific sustainability risk fil- ter, a sustainability questionnaire and a sustainability audit. In addition, the technical and financial capabilities of suppliers – especially those supplying for modular- based production – are continuously monitored during both the development and production phases of the Group’s vehicles. Supplier sites are assessed for expo- sure to natural hazards, such as floods or earthquakes, in order to identify supply risks at an early stage and im- plement appropriate countermeasures.
Raw materials management procedures are in place to mitigate the risk of a production interruption due to shortages of supplies of critical raw materials. The supply risk is also reduced by developing and implementing systems governing minimum inventory levels.

85 BMW Stock and Capital Markets
The level of risk attached to supply risks is (in contrast to last year) classified as high, mainly due to the insuffi- cient availability of raw materials in Asia.
Sales and marketing
Changes in global economic conditions and increas- ingly protectionist trends are among the factors that could result in lower demand as well as fluctuations
in the regional spread and the composition of sales of vehicles and mobility services. Risks relating to these developments can be reduced with the aid of flexible selling and production processes. Increased competition on the world’s markets, particularly in Western Europe, the USA and China, requires constant analysis of selling prices and margins. Selling price and margin risks are determined on the basis of past experience and changing global economic conditions, with risk exposures meas- ured using a cash-flow-at-risk model.
Selling risks generally entail high levels of risk. This clas- sification remains unchanged from the previous year.
Risks relating to pension obligations
The BMW Group’s pension obligations to its employees resulting from defined benefit plans are measured on the basis of actuarial reports. Future pension payments are discounted by reference to market yields on high- quality corporate bonds. These yields are subject to mar- ket fluctuation and therefore influence the level of pen- sion obligations. Changes in other parameters, such
as rises in inflation and longer life expectancy, also im- pact pension obligations and payments.
Most of the BMW Group’s pension obligations are administered in external pension funds or trust arrange- ments and the related assets are kept separate from Company assets. The amount of funds required to finance pension payments out of operations in the future is therefore substantially reduced, since most of the Group’s pension obligations are settled out of pension fund assets. The pension assets of the BMW Group comprise interest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and other investment classes. Pension fund assets are monitored continuously and managed on a risk-and-yield basis. A broad spread of investments also helps to reduce risk. In order to reduce fluctuations in pension funding shortfalls, investments are struc- tured to coincide with the timing of pension payments and the expected pattern of pension obligations. Re- measurements on the obligations and fund asset sides are recognised, net of deferred taxes, in “Other com-
prehensive income” and hence directly in equity (within revenue reserves).
As in the previous year, the level of risk attached to pen- sion obligations is classified as high, whereas the poten- tial impact on earnings is classified as medium.
Further information on risks in conjunction with pension provisions is provided in note 31 of the Group Financial Statements.
Information, data protection and IT risks
The BMW Group attaches great importance to the protection of business secrets and employee and cus- tomer information against unauthorised access and /  or misuse. Data and information security, based on International Security Standard ISO / IEC 27001, is an integral component of all business processes. Staff, process design and information technology each play a key role in the Group’s overall risk and security concept.
Standardised requirements, documented in guidelines and manuals, are applicable group-wide. All employees are required to treat confidential information (such
as customer and employee data) in an appropriate way, ensure that information systems are properly used and that risks pertaining to information technology are handled with transparency. Regular communication, awareness-raising activities and training measures pro- mote a high degree of security and risk awareness among the employees involved. A new Web-based data protection training programme shows how prudent handling of personal data can make the BMW Group more attractive as an employer and have a positive im- pact on customer loyalty. Employees receive training from the Group’s Compliance Organisation to ensure compliance with applicable requirements and in-house rules.
Potential IT and data protection risks resulting from the use of information technology and the processing of information are systematically documented, monitored on a regular basis and dealt with by the departments responsible.
Standard technical data protection procedures in con- stant use include virus scanners, firewall systems, access controls at both operating system and application level, internal testing procedures and the regular backing up of data. Additional measures (e. g. data encryption) are
72
 
73 CoMBinedManageMentRepoRt
in place to protect highly confidential information, such as corporate strategies. A high level of protection is afforded by regular analyses, detailed up-front controls (such as compliance with mandatory data protection requirements) and rigorous security management.
The volume of enquiries with respect to data protection has risen sharply in the wake of the NSA scandal and the public debate regarding a possible new EU directive on data protection. The BMW Group’s well-established data protection network ensures the necessary trans- parency and timely implementation of measures. Re- sponsibility for data protection in each Group entity lies with the Board of Management (of BMW AG) or the relevant Company management. Each entity has one or more Local Data Privacy Protection Officers.
In the case of cooperation arrangements and business partner relationships, the BMW Group protects its in- tellectual property as well as its customer and employee data by stipulating clear instructions with regard to data protection and the use of information technology. Information pertaining to key areas of expertise is sub- ject to particularly stringent security measures.
The requirements placed on IT facilities – both exter- nally and internally – are changing at a breathtaking pace in the face of technological developments in this area. There is a risk that these requirements will neces- sitate far-reaching changes in IT systems, which could entail a higher level of expenditure than currently forecast. Forward-looking planning procedures are in place to manage and implement new IT requirements on a project basis. Risks identified during the imple- mentation of complex IT applications, routine opera- tions and / or in conjunction with the development
of the existing IT landscape are highlighted at an early stage by IT risk management procedures and acted upon accordingly.
The levels of risk attached to information, data protec- tion and IT risks are classified as medium. There has been no change in this assessment compared to the previous year.
Financial risks and risks relating to the use of
financial instruments
Currency risks
As an internationally operating enterprise, the BMW Group conducts business in a variety of currencies, thus exposing itself to currency risks. Since a substantial portion of Group revenues is generated outside the
eurozone (particularly in China and the USA) and the procurement of production materials and funding is also organised on a worldwide basis, the currency risk is an extremely important factor for Group earnings.
Cash-flow-at-risk models and scenario analyses are used to measure exchange rate risks. The results of these analyses are regularly fed into the Group’s fore- cast of exposures and serve as the basis for decision- making with respect to operational currency manage- ment. In 2013 the Chinese renminbi, the US dollar, the British pound, the Russian rouble and the Japanese yen constituted approximately 75 % of the total foreign currency exposure of the BMW Group, with the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar accounting for the lion’s share of foreign currency transactions.
The BMW Group manages currency risks both at a strategic level (medium and long term) and at an oper- ating level (short and medium term). Medium- and long-term measures include increasing production vol- umes in non-euro-region countries (natural hedging) and increasing purchase volumes denominated in for- eign currencies. Constructing new plants in countries such as the USA, China or Brazil have also helped reduce foreign currency exposures. Currency risks are managed in the short to medium term and for operational pur- poses by means of hedging. Hedging transactions are entered into only with financial partners of good credit standing. A description of the methods applied for risk measurement and hedging is provided in note 42 to the Group Financial Statements. Counterparty risk management procedures are carried out continuously in order to monitor the creditworthiness of business partners.
A high level of risk is attached to short-term currency risks. The potential impact on earnings is classified as medium. The level of risk rises in the medium term due to the lower number of hedge transactions entered into for this period.
If the relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled, deriva- tives used by the BMW Group are accounted for as hedging relationships. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in note 42 to the Group Financial Statements.
Raw materials price risks
The availability of raw materials and the related price risks are monitored on the basis of a set of well-defined management procedures. Price risks relating to precious

metals (platinum, palladium), non-ferrous metals (alu- minium, copper, lead) and, to some extent, steel and steel ingredients (iron ore, coke / coal) are hedged using financial derivatives. Purchase contracts with fixed pricing arrangements are also in place. A description of the methods applied for risk measurement and hedging is provided in note 42 to the Group Financial Statements.
Changes in the price of crude oil, as an important basic material in the manufacture of components, have an indirect impact on production costs. The price of crude oil, combined with exchange rate fluctuations, also has an impact on fuel prices, which, in turn, directly in- fluence the purchasing behaviour of our customers and hence the overall demand for vehicles. The BMW Group counters this risk by developing and selling highly efficient, low-consumption engines and by developing alternative drive technologies.
A high level of risk in the short therm is attached to raw material risks. The potential impact on earnings is classified as medium. The level of risk rises in the medium term, due to the lower number of hedge trans- actions entered into for this period.
If the relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled, deriva- tives used by the BMW Group are accounted for as hedging relationships. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in note 42 to the Group Financial Statements.
Liquidity risks
Based on experience gained during the financial crisis, a target liquidity concept is rigorously adhered to. Solvency is assured at all times throughout the BMW Group by maintaining a liquidity reserve and by the broad diversification of refinancing sources. The liquid- ity position is monitored continuously at a separate entity level and managed by means of a cash flow re- quirements and sourcing forecast system in place throughout the Group. Liquidity risks can arise in the form of rising refinancing costs on the one hand and restricted access to funds on the other. The major part of the Financial Services segment’s credit financing and lease business is refinanced on capital markets.
Thanks to its excellent creditworthiness, the BMW Group has good access to financial markets and, as in previous years, was able to raise funds at good con- ditions in 2013, reflecting a diversified refinancing
strategy and the solid liquidity base of the BMW Group. Internationally recognised rating agencies have addi- tionally confirmed the BMW Group’s strong creditwor- thiness.
Similar to the previous year, both the level of risk and the potential impact of illiquidity on earnings are clas- sified as low – including the risk of the BMW Group’s rating being downgraded and any ensuing deterioration in financing conditions.
If the relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled, deriva- tives used by the BMW Group are accounted for as hedging relationships. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in note 42 to the Group Financial Statements.
Risks relating to the provision of financial services
The main categories of risk relating to the provision of financial services are credit and counterparty risk, re- sidual value risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. In order to evaluate and manage these risks, a variety of internal methods has been developed based on regulatory environment requirements (such as Basel II / III) and which comply with both national and international standards.
A set of strategic principles and rules derived from regu- latory requirements serves as the basis for risk manage- ment within the Financial Services segment. At the heart of the risk management process is a clear division between front- and back-office activities and a compre- hensive internal control system.
The key risk management tool employed within the Financial Services segment is aimed at ensuring that the Group’s risk-bearing capacity is not exceeded. In this context, all risks defined as “unexpected losses” must be covered at all times by an appropriate asset cushion in the form of equity capital. Unexpected losses are measured using a variety of value-at-risk techniques, adapted to each relevant risk category. Risks are aggre- gated after taking account of correlation effects. The to- tal sum of risks calculated in this way is then compared with the resources available to cover risks (asset cush- ion). The segment’s risk-bearing capacity is monitored continuously with the aid of an integrated limit system which also differentiates between the various risk cate- gories. The segment’s total risk exposure was covered at all times during the past year by the available risk-cover- age volumes.
74
 
75 CoMBinedManageMentRepoRt
Credit and counterparty default risk
Credit and counterparty default risk arises within the Financial Services segment if a contractual partner (i.  e. a customer or dealer) either becomes unable or only partially able to fulfil its contractual obligations, such that lower income is generated or losses incurred. The Financial Services segment utilises a variety of rating systems in order to assess the creditworthiness of its contractual partners. Credit risks are managed at the time of the initial credit decision, based on a calculation of the present value of standard risk costs and subse- quently, during the term of the credit, by using a range of risk provisioning techniques to cover risks emanat- ing from changes in customer creditworthiness. In this context, individual customers are classified by category each month on the basis of their current contractual status, and appropriate levels of allowance recognised in accordance with that classification.
The level of risk attached to credit and counterparty de- fault risks in the short and medium term is high. The potential impact on earnings is classified as medium.
Residual value risk
A related residual value risk exists if the expected mar- ket value of a vehicle at the end of the contractual term is lower than its residual value calculated at the date the contract is entered into. Each vehicle’s market value is forecast on the basis of historical external and internal data and used to predict the expected market value of the vehicle at the end of the contractual period. As part of the process of managing residual value risks, a calcu- lation is performed at the inception of each contract to determine the present value of risk costs. Market devel- opments are observed throughout the contractual period and the risk assessment updated appropriately.
High levels of risk are attached to residual value risks in the short and medium term. The potential impact on earnings for the segments affected in the short and medium term is classified as medium. The potential im- pact on earnings for the Group is classified as medium.
Interest rate risks
Interest rate risks in the Financial Services segment relate to potential losses caused by changes in market interest rates and can arise when fixed interest rate pe- riods for assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet do not match. Interest rate risks in the Financial Services line of business are managed by raising refinanc- ing funds with matching maturities and by employing
interest rate derivatives. Interest rate risks are also managed on the basis of a value-at-risk approach and stipulated limits. Limits are set using a benchmark- oriented approach that focuses on interest rate arrange- ments contained in the original contracts.
The level of risk attached to interest rate risks in the short and medium term is medium. The potential im- pact on earnings in the short and medium term is classified as low.
Liquidity and operational risks
Use of the “matched funding principle” to finance the Financial Services segment’s operations eliminates liquidity risks to a large extent. Regular measurement and monitoring ensure that cash inflows and out- flows from transactions in varying maturity cycles and currencies offset each other. The relevant procedures are incorporated in the BMW Group’s target liquidity concept.
Operational risks are defined in the Financial Services segment as the risk of losses arising as a consequence of the inappropriateness or failure of internal procedures (process risks), people (personnel-related risks), sys- tems (infrastructure and IT risks) and external events (external risks). These four categories of risk also include related legal and reputation risks.
As part of the process of managing operational risks, loss events and risk scenarios are recorded in the Operational Risk Management Suite (OpRisk-Suite) by OpRisk Officers from the various individual units or entities, along with details of probability of occurrence, loss amounts and countermeasures. This comprehen- sive recording and measurement of risk scenarios and loss events in the OpRisk-Suite provides the basis for
a systematic analysis of potential and / or actual opera- tional risks. Annual self-assessments are also carried out. In conjunction with the assessment of risk-bearing capacity, operational risks are measured using the standard approach and compared with the correspond- ing limit.
The level of risk attached to operational risks is medium. The potential impact on earnings is classified as low.
Legal risks
Compliance with the law is a basic prerequisite for the success of the BMW Group. Current law provides the binding framework for the BMW Group’s various

business activities around the world. The growing international scale of operations of the BMW Group, the complexity of the business world and the whole gamut of complex legal regulations increase the risk of laws not being adhered to, simply because they are not known or fully understood.
The BMW Group has established a Compliance Organi- sation aimed at ensuring that its representative bodies, managers and staff act in a lawful manner at all times. Further information on the BMW Group’s Compliance Organisation can be found in the section “Corporate Governance”.
Like all internationally operating enterprises, the BMW Group is confronted with legal disputes relating, among other things, to warranty claims, product liability, in- fringements of protected rights, or proceedings initiated by government agencies. Any of these matters could, among other outcomes, have an adverse impact on the Group’s reputation. Such proceedings are typical for the sector and can arise as a consequence of realigning product or purchasing strategies to suit changed market conditions. Particularly in the US market, class action lawsuits and product liability risks can have substantial financial consequences and cause damage to the Group’s public image. The BMW Group recognises appropriate levels of provision for lawsuits. A part of these risks, especially where the American market is concerned, is insured where this makes business sense. Some risks, however, cannot be assessed in full or completely defy assessment. It cannot be ruled out that losses from damages could arise which are either not covered or not fully covered by insurance policies or provisions. The high quality of the Group’s products, which is ensured by regular quality audits and ongoing improvement measures, helps to reduce this risk. In comparison with competitors, this can also give rise to benefits and op- portunities for the BMW Group. Changes in the regu- latory environment may significantly influence sales volume, revenues and earnings performance in specific markets or economic regions. Further details are pro- vided in the section “Strategic and sector-specific risks”.
The BMW Group is not currently involved in any court or arbitration proceedings which, based on the enter- prise’s assessment, could have a significant impact on its financial condition.
As in the previous year, the level of risk attached to legal risks is classified as low. However, it cannot be ruled
out that existing legal risks, if they materialise, could have a significantly adverse effect on the Group’s finan- cial condition. Likewise, it cannot be ruled out that new legal risks, as yet unidentified, could materialise and have a significant adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition.

Report on Opportunities
Management and identification of opportunities
New opportunities regularly present themselves in
the dynamic business environment in which the BMW Group operates. General economic trends and sector- specific developments – including external regulations, suppliers, customers and competitors – are monitored continuously. Identifying opportunities is an integral part of the process of developing strategies and drawing up forecasts for the BMW Group. The significance of opportunities for the BMW Group is classified in the categories “material” or “not material”.
Market, competition and scenario analyses are con- ducted and evaluated and forecasts are drawn up
as part of the process of identifying opportunities. The Group’s product portfolio is permanently reviewed in the light of these analyses and, as appropriate, new product projects are presented to the Board of Manage- ment for consideration.
Opportunities management also covers regular reviews of cost drivers and other factors critical for success. One of the key areas in this context is to ensure optimal operations within the production and supplier network, which are therefore subject to regular review. Potential areas of improvement can be quickly realised after ap- proval by the Board of Management and the benefits factored into earnings forecasts. The forecasts drawn up by the BMW Group reflect the expected impact of tar- geted efficiency improvements on variable and fixed costs. Efficiency improvement targets take account of past experience as well as the current composition of the product portfolio.
Business process optimisation and strict cost control are essential to ensure good profitability and a high return on capital employed. The outlook is drawn up on the assumption that profitability improvement measures will be achieved. One good example of this is the rigor- ous implementation of the so-called “architectural ap- proach”. The new MINI presented in November is
the first vehicle to be built on the basis of this approach. Greater communality of features between different models and product lines, made possible by a modular and architectural approach to building vehicles, helps to improve profitability by reducing development costs and investment on the series development of new vehicles, by generating benefits of scale at the level of production cost and by increasing flexibility in produc- tion. The improved cost basis achieved opens up op- portunities to move into additional market segments
which would have otherwise been unprofitable. The new generation of engines allows a high degree of flexi- bility in production in terms of the number of cylinders and the choice between diesel and petrol engines, thus maximising market potential.
Identified opportunities can be incorporated at short notice into the opportunities management and re- porting system. The implementation of identified op- portunities is undertaken on a decentralised basis and monitored using a variety of suitable instruments. The quarterly forecast report presented to the Board of Management highlights the impact of opportunities that have been realised.
Opportunities
Political and global economic opportunities
Economic conditions influence the operations, financial position, earnings performance and cash flows of the BMW Group. Should the global economy develop sig- nificantly better than reflected in the outlook, revenues and earnings of the BMW Group could be significantly higher than originally predicted. Economic opportuni- ties present themselves in particular from the fact that the BMW Group is fully committed to expanding busi- ness volumes in the world’s growth markets. The BMW Group sees an opportunity for above-average growth in the Chinese market. Potential for recovery is also seen elsewhere, particularly in southern European countries. The outcome could be a sharp increase in sales volumes as well as reduced competitive pressure and improved selling prices. The BMW Group reviews its market fore- casts at frequent intervals, adjusting them when neces- sary to accommodate changed market conditions and make full use of available market potential.
In addition to the impact from economic developments, the BMW Group’s earnings can also be positively af- fected in the short to medium term by changes in the le- gal environment. A possible reduction in tariff barriers, in import restrictions or direct excise duties could lower the cost of materials for the BMW Group and also en- able products and services to be offered to the customer at lower prices. Another factor to consider is that regu- latory support for forward-looking technologies, such as electromobility – in the form of incentives – help to make the total cost of ownership more attractive for the customer, thus opening up opportunities for faster mar- ket penetration by means of these technologies. Oppor- tunities of this nature could result in higher sales vol- umes and, all other things being equal, to an improved

quality of earnings. Changes in the legal environment are monitored continuously at a centralised level. The impact of legislation that has been enacted or that is highly likely to be enacted is incorporated in the out- look.
At present, the BMW Group does not see any significant political and / or economic opportunities which could have a positive sustainable impact on the earnings per- formance of the BMW Group.
Strategic and sector-specific opportunities
Innovation and a strong technological position are the cornerstones of our success. The BMW Group con- tinues to build on this solid basis and to set its sights on putting these to good use in the world’s growth mar- kets. Additions to the product portfolio and expansion in growth regions are seen as the most important op- portunities for growth in the medium to long term. Remaining on growth course depends above all else on the ability to develop innovative products and bring them to market. The launching of the BMW i brand opens up new customer target groups for the BMW Group and consolidates the position of BMW as a sus- tainable and forward-looking brand. The BMW i3 is the first car built from the outset as an electric vehicle for driving in an urban environment: optimally de- signed for intelligent mobility in cities and for com- muting, powered by a zero-emission electric drive sys- tem. Creating the BMW i3 does nothing less than make the whole Group fit for the future. A whole new vista of opportunities has now been opened up. BMW i products can be seen as “empowerment projects” for new technologies and processes, which will also bene- fit other vehicle concepts.
With the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo and the MINI Paceman, 2013 also saw the successful launching of two further crossover products on the market. With all of these new models, the BMW Group has demonstrated its ability to translate identified opportunities into com- mercial reality as well as its proactive commitment to tackling the challenges of the future. These products are the outcome of the early identification of growth oppor- tunities and customer-oriented product development processes stretching over several years. Additional op- portunities for growth can be generated by further addi- tions to the product portfolio. Given the lead time re- quired for product development, these opportunities are built into short- and medium-term forecasts. The accept-
ance of, and sales volumes generated with, planned fu- ture product innovations could be better than expected in the outlook. In the short term, however, any potential positive impact is classified as not material.
The long-term trend towards greater sustainability pro- vides opportunities to boost sales of sustainable prod- ucts and, under the right circumstances, achieve better selling prices. Innovations – such as the BMW i3 in the field of electromobility or Efficient Dynamics through- out the whole product portfolio – provide excellent plat- forms for future growth.
Potential is also seen by engaging in new product and market categories and by tapping new customer target groups. New business models and cooperation arrange- ments with the BMW Group’s growing network of business partners often provide the best means to take advantage of these opportunities. Working together with other business partners helps to increase market coverage, expand the range of solutions on offer and encourage the development of forward-looking tech- nologies. Good examples of this are the partnerships and programmes comprising the 360° ELECTRIC port- folio in the field of electromobility and collaboration with Toyota on a hydrogen fuel cell system. Coopera- tions of this kind generally result in greater availability of a wider range of new technologies for the customer and increase the likelihood of a successful market launch in the long term. The short- to medium-term impact of such activities is generally not material.
Given the long lead times involved in developing new products and processes, strategic and sector-specific opportunities are not expected to have a material short- term impact on the earnings performance of the BMW Group.
Opportunities from operational activities
Employees make a vital contribution to sustainable growth and improved profitability through their inno- vative skills. The BMW Group is constantly refining the tools it uses to recruit employees, encourage career development and bind employees to the enterprise. Within this environment, employees find the optimal environment in which to develop their skills. If these measures generate greater benefits than currently expected, the BMW Group’s revenue, earnings perfor- mance and cash flows could be positively impacted and forecasted figures surpassed. Creating a successful
78
 
79 CoMBinedManageMentRepoRt
performance culture and the development of the skill- sets of both staff and managers alike throughout the or- ganisation could also have a positive impact on revenues and profitability. Compared to the outlook, the BMW Group’s earnings performance is unlikely to benefit from efficiency improvements to a significantly greater ex- tent than that incorporated in the outlook.
Further opportunities may arise due to other technical innovations relating to products and processes and as
a result of organisational changes. In the field of light- weight construction, carbon is being put to use in high volumes for the first time in the automobile industry in the construction of the BMW i3. The potential for effi- ciency improvements in this area is quite considerable, including the increased use of this material in other vehi- cle projects, as a result of which the competitiveness of the products involved – both in terms of consumption and driving dynamics – could be improved to a signifi- cantly greater extent than originally planned. The op- portunities presented by these new developments are primarily relevant for the medium to long term and will not have a material short-term impact on the BMW Group’s earnings performance.
The BMW Group focuses its selling capacities primarily on markets with the greatest sales volume and revenue potential and fastest growth rates. Investment in exist- ing and new marketing concepts is firmly aimed at in- tensifying relationships with customers. A good exam- ple is the new marketing concept for BMW i products and services, which will be offered in selected markets in the future via an innovative multi-channel model. There will be no let-up in the active search for new op- portunities to create even greater added value for cus- tomers than currently expected, whilst at the same time looking for ways to boost sales volumes and achieve better selling prices.
Developments in the field of digital communication are also opening up opportunities for marketing the BMW Group’s various brands. Consumers can meanwhile be reached on a more targeted and individual basis, thus helping to strengthen long-term relationships and brand loyalty. The BMW Group keeps track of the latest developments and trends in communication technology, including the use of social media and networks, in order to extend customer reach. The BMW Group’s brands are present on numerous platforms, such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Thanks to its intensive efforts in
this area, the BMW Group is registering faster growth rates on the various platforms than its competitors, measured in terms of the number of fans and visits. The decisive advantage of digital communication is that the brands are able to engage in a direct dialogue with customers and thus create a more intense brand expe- rience. The BMW Group considers that these opportu- nities will not have a material impact compared to the assumptions made in the outlook.
Pension benefits represent an important component of the BMW Group’s overall remuneration package, mak- ing it easier to recruit qualified staff and to gain them for the enterprise on a long-term basis. Pension liabili- ties are matched in part by corresponding pension plan assets. Within a favourable capital market environment, the return generated by pension assets may exceed expectations and reduce the deficit of the relevant pen- sion plans. This, in turn, could have a materially favour- able impact on the net assets position and earnings per- formance of the BMW Group. Pension plan assets also help to reduce the interest and inflation risks attached to pension liabilities.
Financial opportunities arising from currencies
and raw materials
The ability to compete on global markets is also signifi- cantly influenced by changes in exchange rates and raw materials prices. Favourable developments in exchange rates (in particular for China and the USA) and in raw materials prices could have a positive impact on the financial result of the BMW Group. Developments on the financial markets are closely monitored, in order to identify and make the best use of any opportunities that may arise. Financial opportunities are managed by employing the same processes and methodologies used to manage financial risks. The principal objective of these management processes is to reduce risk by improv- ing forecasting reliability. Currency and raw material price opportunities could have a material impact on the earnings performance of the BMW Group.
5.C RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES

Toyota believes that its long-term success depends on its ability to secure a leadership position with respect to vehicle research and development.

Toyota’s research and development expenditures were approximately ¥807.4 billion in fiscal 2013, ¥779.8 billion in fiscal 2012 and ¥730.3 billion in fiscal 2011.

For this reason, Toyota is promoting next generation environmentally friendly, energy efficient, and safe vehicle technology in its research and development. Toyota is making efforts to produce vehicles that are friendly to the environment and human beings, with efforts focused in the following fields:

 

 	•	 	
further improvements in hybrid technologies (functions, costs, etc.) and subsequent environmental contributions;

 

 	•	 	
improvement in gasoline engine fuel economy and improvement of technology in connection with more stringent emissions standards;

 

 	•	 	
promoting improvements in clean diesel engine functioning and fuel economy;

 

 	•	 	
development of electric vehicles, fuel-electric vehicles and other alternative fuel vehicles; and

 

 	•	 	
development of technology designed to promote driving and vehicle safety.

Toyota’s belief is that the environment is one of the most important issues. Toyota is aiming to lower the volume of carbon dioxide emissions at all stages of operations, including development, production, logistics, usage, disposal and recycling of vehicles, as well as the reduction of environmental burdens. Toyota also utilizes various energy resources as a substitute to oil, and has successfully developed a plug-in hybrid vehicle which can be charged from domestic power supplies. Toyota is committed to realize the mass production of electric vehicles, the development of next-generation batteries, and the development of alternative fuel vehicles such as biofuel and fuel-cell vehicles. Toyota aims to maintain its leadership position in environmental technology, and is responding to environmental issues, the representative example being the Prius, the hybrid car introduced to the Japanese market in 1997.

In May 2010, Toyota invested in Tesla Motors, Inc. (“Tesla”) in the amount of $50 million as part of a basic agreement with Tesla to implement a joint venture related to the development, technology, and production systems of electric vehicles and their components. At the 26th International Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium held in May 2012, Toyota announced the jointly developed electric vehicle, the RAV4 EV, which was released in California in summer 2012.

Toyota’s research and development activities focus on the environment, vehicle safety, information technology and product development.

Toyota’s environmental research and development activities focus on:

 

 	•	 	
Developing light-weight and more fuel-efficient engines and transmissions. These technologies include improved technologies in fuel economy, emission, and performance, such as the development of next-generation direct injection system and variable valve system for gasoline engines and the development of the next-generation ultra high pressure common rail system and the diesel particulate and nitrous oxide reduction system for diesel engines.

 

 	•	 	
Developing alternative fuel powering systems for commercial sale. This includes developing hybrid vehicles and fuel cell hybrid vehicles. The second-generation Prius that Toyota introduced in September 2003 features a new hybrid system which decreases negative environmental impact while increasing power and performance. Furthermore, the third-generation Prius was introduced in 2009, and broke the record for sales by vehicle type which was previously held by the Corolla. The Aqua (called Prius c in the US), introduced in December 2011 and sold in approximately 50 countries worldwide, is a world leader in fuel economy and low pricing. In addition, Toyota’s cumulative sales of hybrid vehicles has exceeded 5 million units, which contributed approximately 34 million ton reduction in CO2 emissions. In July 2007, Toyota developed the Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle (“PHV”) and received certification from Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (“MLIT”). PHV runs as an Electric Vehicle (“EV”) in short distances and runs as a regular hybrid vehicle in long distances. Tests are conducted in Japan, North America and Europe and in late 2009, Toyota commenced its sale of PHV with lithium ion batteries to fleet vehicle users in Japan, North America and Europe. Toyota also commenced its sale of PHV models in January 2012, which can be charged

from domestic power supplies in Japan, North America and Europe. In addition, in September 2008, Toyota started leasing the new Toyota Fuel Cell Hybrid Vehicle — advanced (the “new Toyota FCHV-adv”). The new Toyota FCHV-adv has completely overhauled its fuel cell system and has made significant improvements to low-temperature startup performance and cruising distance, which had posed challenges to promoting its widespread use. Toyota believes that fuel cell vehicles will be strong eco-cars for future generations. By 2015, Toyota plans to introduce sedan-type fuel cell vehicles at reasonable prices for customers in Japan, the United States and Europe where appropriate infrastructure is expected to be available. To control increases in oil prices and reduce the consumption of oil, the proliferation of fuel alternatives to oil such as biofuel and natural gas is expanding in some countries. Toyota works towards the ongoing formation of a mobility society through the introduction to the market of low-ethanol content vehicles (“E10”), natural gas vehicles and high-concentration flex-fuel vehicles (“FFV”) that are compatible with ethanol fuel, as well as through research and development into other practical uses of oil alternatives and biofuels, such as research into fuels that will not compete with food production, and into genetically modified organism (“GMO”) technology in order to process sugarcane more efficiently.

Engaging in recycling activities that take into account the lifecycle (development, manufacture, use, disposal) of a vehicle. Research and development focuses primarily on (1) developing materials that are suitable for recycling and designs that facilitate dismantling parts, and (2) research on effective dismantling technology of end-of-life vehicles and use of recycle materials.

Toyota’s work in the area of vehicle safety is focused on the development of technologies designed to prevent accidents in the first instance, as well as the development of technologies that protect passengers and reduce the damage on impact in the event of an accident. Safety technologies in development include:

 

 	•	 	
research on protecting diverse passengers, including senior citizens,

 

 	•	 	
autonomous driving support systems, including pre-collision system, and

 

 	•	 	
data exchange driving-support systems using advanced communication technologies.

To expand the frontiers of safety technology in automobiles, Toyota completed in 1995 its first prototype Advanced Safety Vehicle, the ASV-1. The ASV-2, which was introduced in 2000, incorporates emerging technologies, such as an autonomous safety support system that uses CCD stereo cameras to recognize obstacles in traffic lanes and an infrastructure-harmonized safety support system to warn the driver of pedestrian crossings. In 2002, Toyota conducted road testing of the ASV-3, a prototype based on further improved infrastructure-harmonized system. With the February 2003 introduction of the Harrier in Japan, Toyota became the first car manufacturer to implement a pre-collision system in its automobiles. This advanced system utilizes pre-collision sensors that use millimeter wave radar and cameras to detect objects presenting hazards, and in addition to alerting the driver to the danger of potential collisions, this system employs a brake assist mechanism that utilizes power-assisted braking to minimize the speed on impact, and automatically applies the vehicle’s brakes when a collision is determined to be inevitable. In February 2004, Toyota introduced the pre-collision system for the first time in the United States by equipping the LS430 with the above features.

In September 2006, at the time of introduction of LS460 in Japan, Toyota established the world’s first enhanced pre-collision system, which added functions to detect pedestrians in front, to support driver steering, and to react to vehicle collision.

In February 2008, Toyota developed the world’s first driver monitoring pre-collision system for the Crown sold in Japan, that monitors whether the driver’s eyes are open, in addition to the face monitor which monitors the direction in which the driver is facing.

In addition, in 2011, Toyota established the Collaborative Safety Research Center aimed at reducing the number of traffic accident related deaths through cooperation with various hospitals and universities in North America. Toyota is greatly fortifying its efforts toward product safety and quality, and this research center is part of these efforts. Established within the same research center is the Toyota Technical Center (“TTC”), which is

Table of Contents
the research and development center of Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America, Inc. At the TTC, Toyota’s technicians based in Japan also take part in planning, and perform research focused on reducing the risk of distracted or impaired driving behaviors, as well as the protection of vulnerable demographics such as young children and the elderly. Toyota is also promoting the spread of safe vehicle technologies, and is implementing analyses of traffic accident and driver behavior data. Toyota is planning to invest in the amount of 50 million dollars over the next 5 years, starting from 2011.

In order to promote further streamlining of the global external decision-making process with respect to the development of vehicle safety technologies, Toyota appointed a Chief Safety Technology Officer (“CSTO”) in 2011, who will execute a general integration of safety technology within Toyota’s technology department.

Toyota’s product development program uses a series of methods which are generally intended to promote timely and appropriate responses to changing market demand. These methods include:

 

 	•	 	
optimizing and eliminating vehicle platforms,

 

 	•	 	
sharing parts and components among multiple vehicles,

 

 	•	 	
shortening the time for development and production preparation by the simultaneous study of design and production engineering processes, and

 

 	•	 	
using simulation technology for production design and evaluation.

Toyota carefully analyzes patents and the need for patents in each area of research to formulate more effective research and development strategies. Toyota identifies research and development projects in which it should acquire patents, and files relevant applications as necessary to help build a strong global patent portfolio.

In addition, Toyota wishes to contribute to sustainable mobility by promoting the spread of technologies with environmental and safety benefits. This is why Toyota takes an open stance to patent licensing, and grants licenses when appropriate terms are met. For example, in March 2004, Toyota and Ford Motor Company entered into licensing agreements for patents related to hybrid systems and emissions purification. In addition, in March 2010, Toyota and Mazda Motor Corporation entered into a licensing agreement regarding the supply of hybrid system technology.

Toyota does not consider any one group of patents or licenses to be so important that their expiration or termination would materially affect Toyota’s business. For a further discussion of Toyota’s intellectual property, see “Information on the Company — Business Overview — Intellectual Property”.

5.D TREND INFORMATION

For a discussion of the trends that affect Toyota’s business and operating results, see “— Operating Results” and “— Liquidity and Capital Resources”.

5.E OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Toyota uses its securitization program as part of its funding through special purpose entities for its financial services operations. Toyota is considered the primary beneficiary of these special purpose entities and therefore consolidates them. Toyota has not entered into any off-balance sheet securitization transactions during fiscal 2013.

Lending Commitments

Credit Facilities with Credit Card Holders

Toyota’s financial services operations issue credit cards to customers. As customary for credit card businesses, Toyota maintains credit facilities with holders of credit cards issued by Toyota. These facilities are

 

90

Table of Contents
used upon each holder’s requests up to the limits established on an individual holder’s basis. Although loans made to customers through these facilities are not secured, for the purposes of minimizing credit risks and of appropriately establishing credit limits for each individual credit card holder, Toyota employs its own risk management policy which includes an analysis of information provided by financial institutions in alliance with Toyota. Toyota periodically reviews and revises, as appropriate, these credit limits. Outstanding credit facilities with credit card holders were ¥245.2 billion as of March 31, 2013.

Credit Facilities with Dealers

Toyota’s financial services operations maintain credit facilities with dealers. These credit facilities may be used for business acquisitions, facilities refurbishment, real estate purchases, and working capital requirements. These loans are typically collateralized with liens on real estate, vehicle inventory, and/or other dealership assets, as appropriate. Toyota obtains a personal guarantee from the dealer or corporate guarantee from the dealership when deemed prudent. Although the loans are typically collateralized or guaranteed, the value of the underlying collateral or guarantees may not be sufficient to cover Toyota’s exposure under such agreements. Toyota prices the credit facilities according to the risks assumed in entering into the credit facility. Toyota’s financial services operations also provide financing to various multi-franchise dealer organizations, referred to as dealer groups, often as part of a lending consortium, for wholesale inventory financing, business acquisitions, facilities refurbishment, real estate purchases, and working capital requirements. Toyota’s outstanding credit facilities with dealers totaled ¥1,795.8 billion as of March 31, 2013.

Guarantees

Toyota enters into certain guarantee contracts with its dealers to guarantee customers’ payments of their installment payables that arise from installment contracts between customers and Toyota dealers, as and when requested by Toyota dealers. Guarantee periods are set to match the maturity of installment payments, and as of March 31, 2013, ranged from one month to 35 years. However, they are generally shorter than the useful lives of products sold. Toyota is required to execute its guarantee primarily when customers are unable to make required payments.

The maximum potential amount of future payments as of March 31, 2013 is ¥1,849.4 billion. Liabilities for these guarantees of ¥6.5 billion have been provided as of March 31, 2013. Under these guarantee contracts, Toyota is entitled to recover any amounts paid by it from the customers whose obligations it guaranteed.
