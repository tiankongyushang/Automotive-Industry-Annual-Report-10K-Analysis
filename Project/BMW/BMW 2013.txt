Research and development play a vital role for the BMW Group, given its broad range of products and the high number of new models. Our vehicles and services also set standards in terms of connecting car occupants with the outside world. During 2013, a total of 11,359 employees were engaged throughout the BMW Group’s global research and innovation network at twelve locations spread over five countries, to deliver the best product quality possible and develop innova- tive technologies for customers. Further information on our research and development activities is provided in the relevant section of the Report on Economic Position. 
Research and development expenditure for the year rose by 21.3 % to € 4,792 million, mostly for projects aimed at securing the Group’s future business (2012: € 3,952 million). The research and development ratio was 6.3 %, 1.2 percentage points higher than in the previous year (2012: 5.1 %). 
The ratio of capitalised development costs to total re- search and development costs for the period (capitali- sation ratio) was 36.4 % (2012: 27.6 %). Amortisation of capitalised development costs totalled € 1,069 million (2012: € 1,130 million). Further information on research and development expenditure is provided in the section Results of Operations, Financial Position and Net Assets and in note 10 to the Group Financial Statements. 
As one of the most innovative companies in the auto- mobile industry, suppliers and external providers are also highly involved in our research and development activities. Close collaboration with the parties concerned enables us to offer our customers new technologies more quickly and underscores our aspiration to be inno- vation leader in the sector. It also helps us to ensure that important project-related technological expertise remains within the BMW Group. 
Fleet carbon emissions2, 3
The BMW Group is continually reducing fleet carbon emissions by making its drivetrain systems more effi- cient and increasing the scope of electrification, while still setting standards in terms of sporting flair and dynamic driving pleasure.
The volume of carbon emissions produced by our vehi- cle fleet sold in Europe3 continued to fall thanks to the rigorous deployment of our Efficient Dynamics tech- nologies, and amounted to 133 g CO / km (2012: 138 g
CO2 / km; – 3.6 %).Efficient Dynamics
The vehicles produced by the BMW Group feature in- telligent lightweight design, optimised aerodynamic characteristics and efficient engines. The well-thought- out mixture of materials used to build our vehicles enables us to continually reduce their weight. The BMW Group is also one of the world’s leaders in the use of CFRP in car production. The lightweight material is at least as strong, but up to 50 % lighter than steel and around 30 % lighter than aluminium. When combined with an aluminium chassis, a thermoplastic outer skin and comprehensive weight optimisation in many other components, the CFRP passenger compartment used in the BMW i3 is currently the most effective implementation of intelligent lightweight carmaking on the market.
As from 2014, a completely new family of engines fea- turing BMW TwinPower turbo technology will power the first BMW and MINI models with new 3-, 4- and 6-cylinder in-line engines, ensuring that the best pos- sible Efficient Dynamics technology is available in all segments and performance categories.
The EU6 emission standard, which is mandatory for all newly registered automobiles as from autumn 2014, has already been met for most new BMW and MINI models since 2013. BMW Blue Performance technology ensures that the reduction in the percentage of nitrogen oxide in emissions required by the EU6 standard has been ful- filled for BMW’s diesel models.
In the field of electromobility, too, the BMW Group is relying on in-house developments for its drive systems. BMW eDrive embraces all of the drive system compo- nents required for fully electric driving, i.e. the electric motor, power electronics, e-transmission and high- voltage battery system.
Intelligent energy management ensures that the waste heat generated by the drive system is reduced; kinetic energy is produced as needed and recovered. The BMW Group has done pioneering work in the field of recu- peration technology, which it has gradually been intro- ducing since 2007. The technology generates electrical energy that is fed into the vehicle’s electrical system during acceleration and braking phases.
The BMW i3
The fully electrically powered BMW i3 was launched in 2013 and is the first electric car on the market to com- bine the pleasure of driving so typical for BMW with
electromobility suitable for daily use. It is based on an innovative vehicle concept, which is tailor-made for electromobility and includes a passenger compartment made of CFRP. Driver assistance systems and mobility services from BMW ConnectedDrive as well as the services of 360° ELECTRIC have been specially developed for the BMW i Series. The BMW i3 uniquely combines dynamic driving (from 0 to 100 km / h in 7.2 seconds) with low electricity consumption (12.9 kWh in the EU test cycle). It is powered by a lithium-ion battery spe- cially developed and produced by the BMW Group, which is integrated in the underbody to save space. The energy storage capacity gives the car a range of 130 to 160 kilometres under everyday driving conditions.
Connected mobility
With the new orientation of BMW ConnectedDrive ser- vices, BMW continues to extend its outstanding posi- tion as leading provider worldwide of online-based ser- vices for vehicles. BMW ConnectedDrive is based on two key areas, namely driver assistance systems (con- venience and safety functions) and services (infotain- ment and mobility services). Customers can now order mobility services on an individual basis. Moreover, in- dividual services can be ordered for limited periods of time. The individualisation of services is now also avail- able for the first time for a used BMW. As a result, both BMW and BMW i customers can benefit from a broad range of services and far lower entry prices. Since July 2013, many BMW models have been equipped with an integrated SIM card as standard. The aim is, by 2017, to connect around five million BMW vehicles worldwide via Connected Drive by means of the permanently in- stalled SIM card.
In future it will be possible to order BMW Connected- Drive services in the newly created BMW Connected- Drive store, an option unique for the market. The store is not only available online, but also when travelling, via the vehicle’s on-board system.
With its intelligent emergency call feature, BMW already offers a broader range of functions than that required by EU legislation for 2015. Automatic position-finding and accident severity detection also help to greatly minimise the time between an accident occurring and the arrival of medical and rescue teams. In future, the intelligent emergency call will be offered as standard in practically all markets and models.
The range of optional driver assistance systems has also been considerably expanded for the new MINI.

Available for the first time are a head-up display above the steering column, the Driving Assistant system in- cluding camera-based, active speed control, collision and pedestrian warning, high beam assistant and traffic sign detection as well as a parking assistant and a re- versing camera.
The diversity of the MINI Connected infotainment pro- gramme, which is unique in its competitive environ- ment, has been additionally increased. The new MINI is the first vehicle in its segment that can be perma- nently equipped with a SIM card, which means it has the emergency call service with automatic position- finding and accident severity detection as well as the MINI teleservices at its disposal. The social networks and infotainment functions, which can be integrated in the vehicle via apps, are now available both for Apple iPhones and for smartphones running the Android operating system.
With functions such as traffic sign recognition and colli- sion warning technology, BMW Motorrad Connected- Ride is bringing camera-based rider assistance systems that are already standard features in BMW cars to the world of motorcycling. The particular challenge in this case is how to implement the functions to suit motor- cycling conditions: the system still needs to work per- fectly when leaning into corners and in all weathers. For example, based on ultrasound technology, the Side View Assist system warns the motorcycle rider of ob- jects located in blind spots and vehicles approaching from the sides by means of orange warning triangles built into the base of the motorcycle’s mirrors.
For a number of years now, the BMW Group has been working on an electronic co-pilot that provides vehicles with highly automated driving capabilities on motor- ways. As early as 2011, a trial vehicle drove from Munich to Nuremburg without assistance from the driver. A highly automated switching from one motorway to an- other at motorway intersections is now also possible, thus managing a further key step in the automated ne- gotiation of motorway networks.
After four years of research work, in 2013 one of the largest field trials worldwide for Car-to-X-Communica- tion simTD (Safe Intelligent Mobility – test field Ger- many), involving more than 120 cars, was completed. Numerous companies in the automotive and commu- nications industries as well as research institutes joined forces to test the electronic connectedness of vehicles and traffic infrastructure. The BMW Group concentrated
particularly on the cross-traffic assistant and the traffic sign assistant. Via radio signals, the cross-traffic assis- tant registers the data of all road users at any given crossing and, with the help of positioning technology that is already available as standard equipment, can manage to avoid many of the accidents that typically occur at crossings. The second main focus was on
the traffic sign assistant, which, alongside a host of other features, informs the driver of current speed limits in traffic guidance systems or of approaching congestion.
Awards for technological innovation and design
Engines newly developed by the BMW Group were awarded two category prizes at the international “Engine of the Year Awards 2013”. An international jury awarded first prize in its capacity class to the 2.0-litre 4-cylinder TwinPower turbo engine, which powers vehicles such as the BMW 1, 3 and 5 Series models. In its class, the 1.6-litre 4-cylinder MINI Twin- Power turbo engine, which powers the MINI Cooper S, recorded its seventh consecutive award win. The suc- cess is further proof of the dominance of the BMW Group with its globally recognised competence in engine development. No other car manufacturer has managed to gain more titles at the Engine of the Year Awards in recent years.
The BMW Group celebrated dual success at the inter- nationally acclaimed “Goldenes Lenkrad” automotive awards. The BMW X5 was voted the most convincing new model of the year in the SUV category – as the first BMW model in this category. In the competition for the “Grünes Lenkrad”, the BMW i3 won hands down against all other brands. The BMW i3 also secured first place in the German Design Award 2014 in the “Trans- portation and Public Space” category. An international jury of experts presented awards not only for the BMW i3, but also for the concept study BMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coupé and the BMW R 1200 GS. A total of six models designed by the BMW Group were honoured at the world’s oldest and widely respected “GOOD DESIGNTM” awards. The independent jury awarded prizes to numerous vehicles, including the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupé, the BMW 3 Series Sedan, the BMW M6 Coupé, the BMW M5 and the MINI Roadster. The BMW Group also celebrated receiving four prizes at the red dot award: product design 2013. In the “Automotive and Transport” category the BMW M6 Gran Coupé, the BMW M135i, the BMW 3 Series Touring and the BMW
R 1200 GS were each awarded the red dot design award for their high-quality design.

puRChasing and supplieR netwoRk
As the leading provider of premium vehicles, the BMW Group operates the supply chain together with its part- ners. The focus here is on achieving the right balance between quality, innovation, flexible supply structures and competitive costs. This enables us, even in a volatile environment, to react swiftly and flexibly to fluctua- tions in demand and to continue improving the quality of our products and services.
Numerous model start-ups
The year under report saw the launch of ten models in total for the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands, for which much of the groundwork was performed by the purchasing team. The BMW i3 incorporates a large number of innovations, implemented thanks to the co- ordinated efforts of our suppliers and our own in-house component manufacturing resources. Furthermore, the new generation of the MINI marks the start of front- wheel drive architecture for the BMW Group.
Internationalisation of procurement markets
In accordance with the basic principle applied that pro- duction follows the market, the BMW Group is increas- ingly shifting value-added processes into its respective sales markets, thus providing a further defence against currency exposures.
High level of investment safeguards productivity and technology lead
The BMW Group’s Purchasing and Supplier team is also responsible for component production sites and carries out regular comparative analyses to ensure the efficiency of our in-house component production facilities. The expansion of the Landshut production plant for carbon fibre parts emphasises the importance that the BMW Group attaches to it as a competence centre for light- weight construction and electromobility. This invest- ment in CFRP technology provides the basis for the large- scale automated series production of carbon fibre parts in the BMW Group.The revised BMW Z4 model was introduced in March 2013. This was followed in June by the launch of the new M6 Gran Coupé, which offers the perfect balance between design, performance and luxury. The new BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo, as the third body variant of this series, came onto the market in June 2013. It combines the Sedan’s sporty, dynamic design with the Touring’s functionality and versatility. The BMW 5 Se- ries revised model has been available in the showrooms since July. In addition to design modifications, a wider selection of engines and additions to its broad choice of features, the new BMW 5 Series offers a more exten- sive range of standard equipment. October saw the market launch of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé. With its low centre of gravity and powerful engine models, the sporty Coupé sets new standards for driving dy- namics in its segment. The third generation of the BMW X5 reached the showrooms in November. The dis- tinguishing features of this successful model are its increased sporting ability and lower fuel consumption.
In April 2013, the BMW Group, together with its joint venture partner Brilliance Automotive, announced the launch of an electric vehicle developed specially for China under the brand name ZINORO.
Successful market launch of the BMW i3
At the end of July 2013, the BMW i3 was presented to the public in three cities simultaneously: London, New York and Beijing. The European sales launch of the BMW i3 in November 2013 was accompanied by an ex- tensive communication campaign. First successes have already been recorded: the numbers of interested parties, test drive enquiries and orders for the BMW premium electric vehicle are surpassing expectations.
The BMW i3 is available directly from 196 European dealerships with BMW i agency agreements (BMW i agents). In selected markets, the sales concept for the BMW i has been extended to include purchase offers by telephone and via the Internet. In addition, BMW i product experts advise interested customers at the BMW i agencies. The coming months will see the launch
of the BMW i3 in the USA, China and Japan, among other countries.
MINI extends model range
In March 2013, the MINI Paceman became the seventh model in the MINI brand range. It is the first Sports Activity Coupé in the premium compact segment. The brand is therefore continuing to extend its model range to include new vehicle concepts. April saw the market launch of the John Cooper Works brand in China. In Shanghai, MINI opened the first Experience Centre for the brand in China.
In November, the BMW Group announced the third generation of the MINI, which will be available on mar- kets worldwide in spring 2014. The new MINI redefines the premium small-car segment and offers numerous innovations.
Rolls-Royce Wraith extends the brand experience
In 2013, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars presented the Wraith, the most potent Rolls-Royce of all time. The Wraith stands out for its unique design and has been available in showrooms since September 2013. The Wraith has received the highest accolades, both in the media and from customers. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars also expanded its global presence in the year under report to include Turkey, the Philippines and Taiwan.
Comprehensive range of services centred
around BMW i
With 360°ELECTRIC, BMW i offers a comprehensive package of services for easy, convenient electromobility. BMW i3 and i8 can be recharged from a domestic power socket. However, customers can charge up even more quickly and conveniently using the BMW i wallbox, which is also available with installation service. A solar car- port is also available as an option. The public ChargeNow network is accessible for customers without private parking facilities. This is a network of public charging infrastructure suppliers who provide access to more than 8,000 charging points located throughout Europe. With ParkNow LongTerm, the customer can rent a long-term parking space with charging station at a car park cooperating in the scheme. BMW Add-on Mobility makes it possible to book a conventional BMW vehicle (e. g. for longer holiday trips) as a further service provided to BMW i customers.

are designed to fulfil our customers’ desire for con- venience. BMW i3 Navigation includes a dynamic range assistant, which provides the customer with reliable information on the location of charging stations along the route or suggests efficient driving styles. The Assis- tance Services package comprises BMW i Connected- Drive functions for smartphone and navigation, which support the driver when charging the vehicle and during the journey. The service package can also include pub- lic transport options in the mobility planning. With a BMW i, the customer is also entitled to the comprehen- sive BMW i Mobile Care package. This includes tele- phone assistance, on-the-spot help and a replacement vehicle if required. As part of the holistic approach of 360°ELECTRIC, a customised maintenance and repair package is also offered in addition.conomic success, the responsible use of resources and the assumption of our social responsibilities are the cornerstones for long-term growth and a continual rise in the value of the business. For this reason, due con- sideration to ecological and social criteria along the entire value-added chain and a clear commitment to the preservation of resources are values that are firmly em- bedded in the philosophy of the BMW Group.
Again in 2013, the Group successfully maintained its leading position among the most sustainable carmakers worldwide – a fact borne out by the top places achieved in prestigious ratings. The BMW share was again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI, Europe and World), making the BMW Group the only carmaker to be consecutively listed in the top three for the last 15 years. In the Global 500 Rating of the Carbon Dis- closure Project (CDP), in 2013 we achieved our best re- sult of all time and with 100 out of 100 possible disclo- sure points and a performance assessment in the best ‘A’ ranking, making us leaders in our sector. More- over, the BMW Group was again included in the British FTSE4Good Index in 2013.
Clean production
The integration of environmental management in all production processes enables us to minimise our use of resources and cushion their environmental impact. Since 2006 we have reduced both the resources utilised and the emissions per vehicle produced by an average of 41.4 %.
In 2013, the utilisation of resources and the emissions per vehicle produced were again reduced by an average of 6.6 % compared with the previous year, thus giving rise to savings of €6.8 million.
Despite extensive in-house production (e. g. CFRP manu- facturing) and the construction / commissioning of new structures worldwide (such as the new foundry at the Landshut plant), we managed to further reduce the energy consumption per vehicle produced to 2.36 MWh or 2.1 %. Improved energy efficiency, the utilisation of highly efficient, ecologically sustainable combined heat and power plants (CHPs) and the use of electricity generated from renewable sources enabled us to reduce the carbon emissions per vehicle produced by 5.6 % to 0.68 tons during the period under report.
In order to generate sufficient energy at its various pro- duction plants, the BMW Group makes good use of its own combined heat and power plants. The calculation of energy efficiency within the BMW Group’s produc- tion network has been adjusted to allow for increased consumption caused by conversion due to the growing use of CHP plants. The previous year’s figures have been adjusted accordingly.
The volume of water required per vehicle produced also fell to 2.18 m3 (– 1.8 %) in 2013. The amount of process wastewater produced decreased by 7.8 % to 0.47 m3 per vehicle produced. Measures implemented due to the continual improvement process and good capacity utili- sation at our plants contributed towards improved efficiency in the use of both energy and water. At the Spartanburg plant in the USA in particular, water con- sumption was lowered by the use of condensed water gained from the cooling system.
The amount of non-recyclable production waste fell significantly by 11.4 % to 5.73 kg per vehicle produced in 2013. A strong contributing factor was the decrease in non-recyclable waste by almost one-quarter (23.3 %) at the Landshut plant.
Solvent emissions were reduced by an impressive 10.7 % to 1.59 kg per vehicle produced during the period un- der report, an achievement primarily due to the retrofit- ting of the paint shop to include an exhaust air filtering system at the Dadong2 plant in China.

Sustainability criteria also play a major role in the field of transport logistics as well as in the selection and as- sessment of our suppliers. Sustainability requirements apply not only to our suppliers, but also to our transpor- tation service providers. The amount of energy needed for transportation purposes has considerably increased in recent years. In order to keep carbon emissions to an absolute minimum, we work on the principle “produc- tion follows the market”. In addition, we are working on improving our packaging and continually increasing the percentage of low-carbon types of transportation. In total, 60.7 % of all new cars left our plants by rail during the twelve-month period under report. Moreover, in 2013 we introduced measures to reduce the volume of goods transported by airfreight.
Carbon emissions reduced across the fleet
The Efficient Dynamics technology package has been helping us reduce the amount of CO2 our vehicles emit for many years. The 100 % electrically powered BMW i3

was added to the BMW Group’s vehicle fleet in 2013. With increasing electrification, including that achieved by means of hybrid technology, we will continue to take a leading role in the lowering of carbon emissions and fuel consumption. Looking into the future, these technologies represent an important basis for fulfilling legally mandatory carbon and consumption limits.
The average carbon emissions of the vehicles we sold in Europe fell by 37 % from 1995 to 2013. The BMW Group’s fleet of new vehicles sold in Europe consumed an average of 4.8 litres of diesel per 100 km and 6.2 litres of petrol respectively. The average carbon emissions in our cars sold in Europe (EU 27) stood at 133 grams per kilometre during the year under report. We also lead the field among German premium-segment manufacturers with carbon emissions of 139 g / km. In 2013 the BMW Group’s fleet already included 39 models using less than 120 g CO2 / km. Our efficient technologies have given us a competitive edge, particularly in markets governed by a CO2-based vehicle tax.Further information on the subject of sustainability in the BMW Group is available in our online sustainability report at: www.bmwgroup.com /sustainability. The Sustainable Value Report 2012 was prepared in ac- cordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G3.1). At Level A+ (GRI-tested) it fulfils the highest degree of application laid down by GRI guidelines.18   Combined management RepoRt

ditions continue to exert an unsettling influence over both markets and consumers. Further risks arise from other potential economic developments, in particular a slowdown of economic momentum in China, one of the BMW Group’s principal markets, which could in turn result in lower demand for the products and services the Group offers. As in the previous year, the risk amounts attached to such an outcome are classified as high.
Any escalation of political conflicts and terrorist ac- tivities, natural disasters or possible pandemics could have a negative impact on the world economy and inter- national capital markets in general. The BMW Group counters these risks primarily by internationalising
its sales and production structures in order to reduce the potential impact of risk exposures in individual countries. The risk amounts attached to these risks are classified as low.
Overall, as in the previous year, the risk amounts at- tached to political and global economic risks are still classified as high.
Strategic and sector-specific risks
Innovation is the driving force behind the BMW Group’s success. The primary source of innovation is a world- wide global research and innovation network, in which employees work closely with one another to find to- day’s solutions for tomorrow’s mobility issues. At the same time, the technical challenges involved in reduc- ing fuel consumption and emission, are constantly on the rise. These requirements are accompanied by a whole swathe of rules that govern individual mobility in metropolitan areas.
New regulations and rising fuel and energy prices also exert an influence on customer behaviour. One sig- nificant risk for the car industry is the possibility that laws and regulations could be tightened at short notice, thus triggering the need for significantly higher levels of investment. In some cases, changes in customer be- haviour are not only brought on by new regulations, but also through changes of opinion, values and environmen- tal issues. Among other factors, global climate change
is having an effect on legislation, regulations and con- sumer behaviour. In order to meet structural changes in the demand for individual mobility that no longer necessarily means actually owning a vehicle, the BMW Group is offering corresponding mobility services, such as the DriveNow car sharing model.
With its Efficient Dynamics concept, the BMW Group is playing a pioneering role in the premium segment in reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. With effect from 2013, our range of products was expanded by the addition of electric powertrains in BMW i series vehicles. This strategy will also enable us to fulfil legal rules and requirements at the same time. The BMW Group is investing in the development of sustainable drive technologies and materials, with the aim of pro- viding highly efficient vehicles for individual mobility in the premium segment, both now and in the future.
The BMW Group is also committed to developing com- prehensive recycling concepts aimed at recycling mate- rials as efficiently as possible, closing material loops and conserving precious resources to the greatest possible extent. Statutory risks stemming from vehicle recycling are minimised by means of a specialised in-house team working in conjunction with regional managers.
Medium- and long-term targets have already been put in place in Europe, North America, Japan, China and other countries to minimise fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Europe has set a target of achieving an aver- age of 130 g CO2   /  km for all new vehicles by 2015. EU regulations set targets for CO2 emissions based on ve- hicle weight. For the BMW Group this means a target of under 140 g CO2   /  km per vehicle. The average for new car fleets in Europe has been set for 2020 at 95 g CO2   /  km. Fuel economy targets have now been fixed in the USA up to the year 2025. Beginning with a gradual reduction for 2012 models, the new car fleets of all manu- facturers are required to achieve an average emission value of 250 g CO2   / mile (155 g CO2   /  km) by model year 2016 and by 2025 an average value of 163 g CO2   / mile (101 g CO2   /  km). Japan has also announced ambitious targets for reducing fuel consumption. The regulations for individual vehicles and fleets have been implemented jointly in China. The debate on the successor regulation has already begun.
The broader market introduction of alternative drive systems presents new challenges and means additional investment for the automotive industry. At the same time the BMW Group also sees the changing situation as an ideal opportunity to put its technological expertise and innovative strengths to good use. Greater fuel economy and the reduction of emissions are fundamen- tal parameters that are automatically integrated in the design of new products.

In the short to medium term, the BMW Group is work- ing on achieving additional fuel economy by deploying a wide range of measures from the electrification of the drivetrain through to hybrid solutions. Solutions for sustainable mobility in densely populated areas are also in the process of being developed. Large-scale field trials with the MINI E have been carried out in the UK, Germany, France, the USA, China and Japan. A test fleet of BMW ActiveE electric cars based on the BMW 1 Se- ries Coupé has been on the road since 2011. The exten- sive knowledge gained from the trials will be used in the series development of the BMW Group’s electric cars. The BMW i3 came onto the market in 2013 as the first series-produced electric car made by the BMW Group and specially designed for the metropolitan regions of the world.
Similar to the statutory requirements being imposed on car manufacturers to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, the rules for car safety are also becoming continuously tougher, such as crash specifications in the USA. The specifications demanded of vehicles are chang- ing so comprehensively that there is no option but to develop new technologies to improve both active and passive safety systems. Active safety systems such as suspension regulation and driver assistance systems make an essential contribution to the prevention of ac- cidents, while passive safety systems help to reduce the consequences of accidents.
As in the previous financial year, the amounts of risk attached to strategic and sector-specific risks are classi- fied as low.
Operational risks
Production
Production stoppages and downtimes – in particular due to fire, but also those attributable to manufacturing equipment breakdowns, logistical disruptions or new vehicle production line start-ups – represent risks which the BMW Group counters with a broad range of appro- priate measures. Production structures and processes are designed from the outset with a view to reducing potential damage and the probability of occurrence. In addition to technical fire protection measures, the BMW Group has implemented an array of strategies, includ- ing preventative maintenance, spare parts management on a multi-site basis and back-up plans for alternative transportation. The level of risk is also reduced by the deployment of flexible work-schedule models and em-
ployee time accounts, but also by the ability to produce specific models at additional sites if necessary. More- over, risks arising from business interruption and loss of production as a consequence of fire or natural disaster are also insured up to economically reasonable levels with insurance companies of good credit standing.
The level of risk attached to production interruptions is classified as medium. There has been no change in this assessment compared to the previous year.
Purchasing
Close cooperation between carmakers and automotive suppliers generates economic benefits on the one hand, but also raises levels of dependency. The increasing trend towards modular-based production with a set of common architectures covering various models and product lines exacerbates the consequences of the loss of a supplier or failure to supply on time. As part of the supplier preselection process, the BMW Group is careful to ensure that its future business partners come up to the same high ecological, social and corporate governance standards by which the BMW Group is generally measured. Suppliers are assessed on the basis of the BMW Group Sustainability Standard which is applied throughout the worldwide supplier network. This set of fundamental principles and standards covers both production and non-production aspects relevant for the goods and services provided by suppliers, which also includes compliance with internationally recog- nised human rights and applicable labour and social standards. The principal tool for ensuring compliance with the BMW Group Sustainability Standard is a three- stage sustainability and risk management approach comprising a BMW Group-specific sustainability risk fil- ter, a sustainability questionnaire and a sustainability audit. In addition, the technical and financial capabilities of suppliers – especially those supplying for modular- based production – are continuously monitored during both the development and production phases of the Group’s vehicles. Supplier sites are assessed for expo- sure to natural hazards, such as floods or earthquakes, in order to identify supply risks at an early stage and im- plement appropriate countermeasures.
Raw materials management procedures are in place to mitigate the risk of a production interruption due to shortages of supplies of critical raw materials. The supply risk is also reduced by developing and implementing systems governing minimum inventory levels.

The level of risk attached to supply risks is (in contrast to last year) classified as high, mainly due to the insuffi- cient availability of raw materials in Asia.
Sales and marketing
Changes in global economic conditions and increas- ingly protectionist trends are among the factors that could result in lower demand as well as fluctuations
in the regional spread and the composition of sales of vehicles and mobility services. Risks relating to these developments can be reduced with the aid of flexible selling and production processes. Increased competition on the world’s markets, particularly in Western Europe, the USA and China, requires constant analysis of selling prices and margins. Selling price and margin risks are determined on the basis of past experience and changing global economic conditions, with risk exposures meas- ured using a cash-flow-at-risk model.
Selling risks generally entail high levels of risk. This clas- sification remains unchanged from the previous year.
Risks relating to pension obligations
The BMW Group’s pension obligations to its employees resulting from defined benefit plans are measured on the basis of actuarial reports. Future pension payments are discounted by reference to market yields on high- quality corporate bonds. These yields are subject to mar- ket fluctuation and therefore influence the level of pen- sion obligations. Changes in other parameters, such
as rises in inflation and longer life expectancy, also im- pact pension obligations and payments.
Most of the BMW Group’s pension obligations are administered in external pension funds or trust arrange- ments and the related assets are kept separate from Company assets. The amount of funds required to finance pension payments out of operations in the future is therefore substantially reduced, since most of the Group’s pension obligations are settled out of pension fund assets. The pension assets of the BMW Group comprise interest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and other investment classes. Pension fund assets are monitored continuously and managed on a risk-and-yield basis. A broad spread of investments also helps to reduce risk. In order to reduce fluctuations in pension funding shortfalls, investments are struc- tured to coincide with the timing of pension payments and the expected pattern of pension obligations. Re- measurements on the obligations and fund asset sides are recognised, net of deferred taxes, in “Other com-
prehensive income” and hence directly in equity (within revenue reserves).
As in the previous year, the level of risk attached to pen- sion obligations is classified as high, whereas the poten- tial impact on earnings is classified as medium.
Further information on risks in conjunction with pension provisions is provided in note 31 of the Group Financial Statements.
Information, data protection and IT risks
The BMW Group attaches great importance to the protection of business secrets and employee and cus- tomer information against unauthorised access and /  or misuse. Data and information security, based on International Security Standard ISO / IEC 27001, is an integral component of all business processes. Staff, process design and information technology each play a key role in the Group’s overall risk and security concept.
Standardised requirements, documented in guidelines and manuals, are applicable group-wide. All employees are required to treat confidential information (such
as customer and employee data) in an appropriate way, ensure that information systems are properly used and that risks pertaining to information technology are handled with transparency. Regular communication, awareness-raising activities and training measures pro- mote a high degree of security and risk awareness among the employees involved. A new Web-based data protection training programme shows how prudent handling of personal data can make the BMW Group more attractive as an employer and have a positive im- pact on customer loyalty. Employees receive training from the Group’s Compliance Organisation to ensure compliance with applicable requirements and in-house rules.
Potential IT and data protection risks resulting from the use of information technology and the processing of information are systematically documented, monitored on a regular basis and dealt with by the departments responsible.
Standard technical data protection procedures in con- stant use include virus scanners, firewall systems, access controls at both operating system and application level, internal testing procedures and the regular backing up of data. Additional measures (e. g. data encryption) are
72
 
73 CoMBinedManageMentRepoRt
in place to protect highly confidential information, such as corporate strategies. A high level of protection is afforded by regular analyses, detailed up-front controls (such as compliance with mandatory data protection requirements) and rigorous security management.
The volume of enquiries with respect to data protection has risen sharply in the wake of the NSA scandal and the public debate regarding a possible new EU directive on data protection. The BMW Group’s well-established data protection network ensures the necessary trans- parency and timely implementation of measures. Re- sponsibility for data protection in each Group entity lies with the Board of Management (of BMW AG) or the relevant Company management. Each entity has one or more Local Data Privacy Protection Officers.
In the case of cooperation arrangements and business partner relationships, the BMW Group protects its in- tellectual property as well as its customer and employee data by stipulating clear instructions with regard to data protection and the use of information technology. Information pertaining to key areas of expertise is sub- ject to particularly stringent security measures.
The requirements placed on IT facilities – both exter- nally and internally – are changing at a breathtaking pace in the face of technological developments in this area. There is a risk that these requirements will neces- sitate far-reaching changes in IT systems, which could entail a higher level of expenditure than currently forecast. Forward-looking planning procedures are in place to manage and implement new IT requirements on a project basis. Risks identified during the imple- mentation of complex IT applications, routine opera- tions and / or in conjunction with the development
of the existing IT landscape are highlighted at an early stage by IT risk management procedures and acted upon accordingly.
The levels of risk attached to information, data protec- tion and IT risks are classified as medium. There has been no change in this assessment compared to the previous year.
Financial risks and risks relating to the use of
financial instruments
Currency risks
As an internationally operating enterprise, the BMW Group conducts business in a variety of currencies, thus exposing itself to currency risks. Since a substantial portion of Group revenues is generated outside the
eurozone (particularly in China and the USA) and the procurement of production materials and funding is also organised on a worldwide basis, the currency risk is an extremely important factor for Group earnings.
Cash-flow-at-risk models and scenario analyses are used to measure exchange rate risks. The results of these analyses are regularly fed into the Group’s fore- cast of exposures and serve as the basis for decision- making with respect to operational currency manage- ment. In 2013 the Chinese renminbi, the US dollar, the British pound, the Russian rouble and the Japanese yen constituted approximately 75 % of the total foreign currency exposure of the BMW Group, with the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar accounting for the lion’s share of foreign currency transactions.
The BMW Group manages currency risks both at a strategic level (medium and long term) and at an oper- ating level (short and medium term). Medium- and long-term measures include increasing production vol- umes in non-euro-region countries (natural hedging) and increasing purchase volumes denominated in for- eign currencies. Constructing new plants in countries such as the USA, China or Brazil have also helped reduce foreign currency exposures. Currency risks are managed in the short to medium term and for operational pur- poses by means of hedging. Hedging transactions are entered into only with financial partners of good credit standing. A description of the methods applied for risk measurement and hedging is provided in note 42 to the Group Financial Statements. Counterparty risk management procedures are carried out continuously in order to monitor the creditworthiness of business partners.
A high level of risk is attached to short-term currency risks. The potential impact on earnings is classified as medium. The level of risk rises in the medium term due to the lower number of hedge transactions entered into for this period.
If the relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled, deriva- tives used by the BMW Group are accounted for as hedging relationships. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in note 42 to the Group Financial Statements.
Raw materials price risks
The availability of raw materials and the related price risks are monitored on the basis of a set of well-defined management procedures. Price risks relating to precious

metals (platinum, palladium), non-ferrous metals (alu- minium, copper, lead) and, to some extent, steel and steel ingredients (iron ore, coke / coal) are hedged using financial derivatives. Purchase contracts with fixed pricing arrangements are also in place. A description of the methods applied for risk measurement and hedging is provided in note 42 to the Group Financial Statements.
Changes in the price of crude oil, as an important basic material in the manufacture of components, have an indirect impact on production costs. The price of crude oil, combined with exchange rate fluctuations, also has an impact on fuel prices, which, in turn, directly in- fluence the purchasing behaviour of our customers and hence the overall demand for vehicles. The BMW Group counters this risk by developing and selling highly efficient, low-consumption engines and by developing alternative drive technologies.
A high level of risk in the short therm is attached to raw material risks. The potential impact on earnings is classified as medium. The level of risk rises in the medium term, due to the lower number of hedge trans- actions entered into for this period.
If the relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled, deriva- tives used by the BMW Group are accounted for as hedging relationships. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in note 42 to the Group Financial Statements.
Liquidity risks
Based on experience gained during the financial crisis, a target liquidity concept is rigorously adhered to. Solvency is assured at all times throughout the BMW Group by maintaining a liquidity reserve and by the broad diversification of refinancing sources. The liquid- ity position is monitored continuously at a separate entity level and managed by means of a cash flow re- quirements and sourcing forecast system in place throughout the Group. Liquidity risks can arise in the form of rising refinancing costs on the one hand and restricted access to funds on the other. The major part of the Financial Services segment’s credit financing and lease business is refinanced on capital markets.
Thanks to its excellent creditworthiness, the BMW Group has good access to financial markets and, as in previous years, was able to raise funds at good con- ditions in 2013, reflecting a diversified refinancing
strategy and the solid liquidity base of the BMW Group. Internationally recognised rating agencies have addi- tionally confirmed the BMW Group’s strong creditwor- thiness.
Similar to the previous year, both the level of risk and the potential impact of illiquidity on earnings are clas- sified as low – including the risk of the BMW Group’s rating being downgraded and any ensuing deterioration in financing conditions.
If the relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled, deriva- tives used by the BMW Group are accounted for as hedging relationships. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in note 42 to the Group Financial Statements.
Risks relating to the provision of financial services
The main categories of risk relating to the provision of financial services are credit and counterparty risk, re- sidual value risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. In order to evaluate and manage these risks, a variety of internal methods has been developed based on regulatory environment requirements (such as Basel II / III) and which comply with both national and international standards.
A set of strategic principles and rules derived from regu- latory requirements serves as the basis for risk manage- ment within the Financial Services segment. At the heart of the risk management process is a clear division between front- and back-office activities and a compre- hensive internal control system.
The key risk management tool employed within the Financial Services segment is aimed at ensuring that the Group’s risk-bearing capacity is not exceeded. In this context, all risks defined as “unexpected losses” must be covered at all times by an appropriate asset cushion in the form of equity capital. Unexpected losses are measured using a variety of value-at-risk techniques, adapted to each relevant risk category. Risks are aggre- gated after taking account of correlation effects. The to- tal sum of risks calculated in this way is then compared with the resources available to cover risks (asset cush- ion). The segment’s risk-bearing capacity is monitored continuously with the aid of an integrated limit system which also differentiates between the various risk cate- gories. The segment’s total risk exposure was covered at all times during the past year by the available risk-cover- age volumes.
74
 
75 CoMBinedManageMentRepoRt
Credit and counterparty default risk
Credit and counterparty default risk arises within the Financial Services segment if a contractual partner (i.  e. a customer or dealer) either becomes unable or only partially able to fulfil its contractual obligations, such that lower income is generated or losses incurred. The Financial Services segment utilises a variety of rating systems in order to assess the creditworthiness of its contractual partners. Credit risks are managed at the time of the initial credit decision, based on a calculation of the present value of standard risk costs and subse- quently, during the term of the credit, by using a range of risk provisioning techniques to cover risks emanat- ing from changes in customer creditworthiness. In this context, individual customers are classified by category each month on the basis of their current contractual status, and appropriate levels of allowance recognised in accordance with that classification.
The level of risk attached to credit and counterparty de- fault risks in the short and medium term is high. The potential impact on earnings is classified as medium.
Residual value risk
A related residual value risk exists if the expected mar- ket value of a vehicle at the end of the contractual term is lower than its residual value calculated at the date the contract is entered into. Each vehicle’s market value is forecast on the basis of historical external and internal data and used to predict the expected market value of the vehicle at the end of the contractual period. As part of the process of managing residual value risks, a calcu- lation is performed at the inception of each contract to determine the present value of risk costs. Market devel- opments are observed throughout the contractual period and the risk assessment updated appropriately.
High levels of risk are attached to residual value risks in the short and medium term. The potential impact on earnings for the segments affected in the short and medium term is classified as medium. The potential im- pact on earnings for the Group is classified as medium.
Interest rate risks
Interest rate risks in the Financial Services segment relate to potential losses caused by changes in market interest rates and can arise when fixed interest rate pe- riods for assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet do not match. Interest rate risks in the Financial Services line of business are managed by raising refinanc- ing funds with matching maturities and by employing
interest rate derivatives. Interest rate risks are also managed on the basis of a value-at-risk approach and stipulated limits. Limits are set using a benchmark- oriented approach that focuses on interest rate arrange- ments contained in the original contracts.
The level of risk attached to interest rate risks in the short and medium term is medium. The potential im- pact on earnings in the short and medium term is classified as low.
Liquidity and operational risks
Use of the “matched funding principle” to finance the Financial Services segment’s operations eliminates liquidity risks to a large extent. Regular measurement and monitoring ensure that cash inflows and out- flows from transactions in varying maturity cycles and currencies offset each other. The relevant procedures are incorporated in the BMW Group’s target liquidity concept.
Operational risks are defined in the Financial Services segment as the risk of losses arising as a consequence of the inappropriateness or failure of internal procedures (process risks), people (personnel-related risks), sys- tems (infrastructure and IT risks) and external events (external risks). These four categories of risk also include related legal and reputation risks.
As part of the process of managing operational risks, loss events and risk scenarios are recorded in the Operational Risk Management Suite (OpRisk-Suite) by OpRisk Officers from the various individual units or entities, along with details of probability of occurrence, loss amounts and countermeasures. This comprehen- sive recording and measurement of risk scenarios and loss events in the OpRisk-Suite provides the basis for
a systematic analysis of potential and / or actual opera- tional risks. Annual self-assessments are also carried out. In conjunction with the assessment of risk-bearing capacity, operational risks are measured using the standard approach and compared with the correspond- ing limit.
The level of risk attached to operational risks is medium. The potential impact on earnings is classified as low.
Legal risks
Compliance with the law is a basic prerequisite for the success of the BMW Group. Current law provides the binding framework for the BMW Group’s various

business activities around the world. The growing international scale of operations of the BMW Group, the complexity of the business world and the whole gamut of complex legal regulations increase the risk of laws not being adhered to, simply because they are not known or fully understood.
The BMW Group has established a Compliance Organi- sation aimed at ensuring that its representative bodies, managers and staff act in a lawful manner at all times. Further information on the BMW Group’s Compliance Organisation can be found in the section “Corporate Governance”.
Like all internationally operating enterprises, the BMW Group is confronted with legal disputes relating, among other things, to warranty claims, product liability, in- fringements of protected rights, or proceedings initiated by government agencies. Any of these matters could, among other outcomes, have an adverse impact on the Group’s reputation. Such proceedings are typical for the sector and can arise as a consequence of realigning product or purchasing strategies to suit changed market conditions. Particularly in the US market, class action lawsuits and product liability risks can have substantial financial consequences and cause damage to the Group’s public image. The BMW Group recognises appropriate levels of provision for lawsuits. A part of these risks, especially where the American market is concerned, is insured where this makes business sense. Some risks, however, cannot be assessed in full or completely defy assessment. It cannot be ruled out that losses from damages could arise which are either not covered or not fully covered by insurance policies or provisions. The high quality of the Group’s products, which is ensured by regular quality audits and ongoing improvement measures, helps to reduce this risk. In comparison with competitors, this can also give rise to benefits and op- portunities for the BMW Group. Changes in the regu- latory environment may significantly influence sales volume, revenues and earnings performance in specific markets or economic regions. Further details are pro- vided in the section “Strategic and sector-specific risks”.
The BMW Group is not currently involved in any court or arbitration proceedings which, based on the enter- prise’s assessment, could have a significant impact on its financial condition.
As in the previous year, the level of risk attached to legal risks is classified as low. However, it cannot be ruled
out that existing legal risks, if they materialise, could have a significantly adverse effect on the Group’s finan- cial condition. Likewise, it cannot be ruled out that new legal risks, as yet unidentified, could materialise and have a significant adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition.

Management and identification of opportunities
New opportunities regularly present themselves in
the dynamic business environment in which the BMW Group operates. General economic trends and sector- specific developments – including external regulations, suppliers, customers and competitors – are monitored continuously. Identifying opportunities is an integral part of the process of developing strategies and drawing up forecasts for the BMW Group. The significance of opportunities for the BMW Group is classified in the categories “material” or “not material”.
Market, competition and scenario analyses are con- ducted and evaluated and forecasts are drawn up
as part of the process of identifying opportunities. The Group’s product portfolio is permanently reviewed in the light of these analyses and, as appropriate, new product projects are presented to the Board of Manage- ment for consideration.
Opportunities management also covers regular reviews of cost drivers and other factors critical for success. One of the key areas in this context is to ensure optimal operations within the production and supplier network, which are therefore subject to regular review. Potential areas of improvement can be quickly realised after ap- proval by the Board of Management and the benefits factored into earnings forecasts. The forecasts drawn up by the BMW Group reflect the expected impact of tar- geted efficiency improvements on variable and fixed costs. Efficiency improvement targets take account of past experience as well as the current composition of the product portfolio.
Business process optimisation and strict cost control are essential to ensure good profitability and a high return on capital employed. The outlook is drawn up on the assumption that profitability improvement measures will be achieved. One good example of this is the rigor- ous implementation of the so-called “architectural ap- proach”. The new MINI presented in November is
the first vehicle to be built on the basis of this approach. Greater communality of features between different models and product lines, made possible by a modular and architectural approach to building vehicles, helps to improve profitability by reducing development costs and investment on the series development of new vehicles, by generating benefits of scale at the level of production cost and by increasing flexibility in produc- tion. The improved cost basis achieved opens up op- portunities to move into additional market segments
which would have otherwise been unprofitable. The new generation of engines allows a high degree of flexi- bility in production in terms of the number of cylinders and the choice between diesel and petrol engines, thus maximising market potential.
Identified opportunities can be incorporated at short notice into the opportunities management and re- porting system. The implementation of identified op- portunities is undertaken on a decentralised basis and monitored using a variety of suitable instruments. The quarterly forecast report presented to the Board of Management highlights the impact of opportunities that have been realised.
Opportunities
Political and global economic opportunities
Economic conditions influence the operations, financial position, earnings performance and cash flows of the BMW Group. Should the global economy develop sig- nificantly better than reflected in the outlook, revenues and earnings of the BMW Group could be significantly higher than originally predicted. Economic opportuni- ties present themselves in particular from the fact that the BMW Group is fully committed to expanding busi- ness volumes in the world’s growth markets. The BMW Group sees an opportunity for above-average growth in the Chinese market. Potential for recovery is also seen elsewhere, particularly in southern European countries. The outcome could be a sharp increase in sales volumes as well as reduced competitive pressure and improved selling prices. The BMW Group reviews its market fore- casts at frequent intervals, adjusting them when neces- sary to accommodate changed market conditions and make full use of available market potential.
In addition to the impact from economic developments, the BMW Group’s earnings can also be positively af- fected in the short to medium term by changes in the le- gal environment. A possible reduction in tariff barriers, in import restrictions or direct excise duties could lower the cost of materials for the BMW Group and also en- able products and services to be offered to the customer at lower prices. Another factor to consider is that regu- latory support for forward-looking technologies, such as electromobility – in the form of incentives – help to make the total cost of ownership more attractive for the customer, thus opening up opportunities for faster mar- ket penetration by means of these technologies. Oppor- tunities of this nature could result in higher sales vol- umes and, all other things being equal, to an improved

quality of earnings. Changes in the legal environment are monitored continuously at a centralised level. The impact of legislation that has been enacted or that is highly likely to be enacted is incorporated in the out- look.
At present, the BMW Group does not see any significant political and / or economic opportunities which could have a positive sustainable impact on the earnings per- formance of the BMW Group.
Strategic and sector-specific opportunities
Innovation and a strong technological position are the cornerstones of our success. The BMW Group con- tinues to build on this solid basis and to set its sights on putting these to good use in the world’s growth mar- kets. Additions to the product portfolio and expansion in growth regions are seen as the most important op- portunities for growth in the medium to long term. Remaining on growth course depends above all else on the ability to develop innovative products and bring them to market. The launching of the BMW i brand opens up new customer target groups for the BMW Group and consolidates the position of BMW as a sus- tainable and forward-looking brand. The BMW i3 is the first car built from the outset as an electric vehicle for driving in an urban environment: optimally de- signed for intelligent mobility in cities and for com- muting, powered by a zero-emission electric drive sys- tem. Creating the BMW i3 does nothing less than make the whole Group fit for the future. A whole new vista of opportunities has now been opened up. BMW i products can be seen as “empowerment projects” for new technologies and processes, which will also bene- fit other vehicle concepts.
With the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo and the MINI Paceman, 2013 also saw the successful launching of two further crossover products on the market. With all of these new models, the BMW Group has demonstrated its ability to translate identified opportunities into com- mercial reality as well as its proactive commitment to tackling the challenges of the future. These products are the outcome of the early identification of growth oppor- tunities and customer-oriented product development processes stretching over several years. Additional op- portunities for growth can be generated by further addi- tions to the product portfolio. Given the lead time re- quired for product development, these opportunities are built into short- and medium-term forecasts. The accept-
ance of, and sales volumes generated with, planned fu- ture product innovations could be better than expected in the outlook. In the short term, however, any potential positive impact is classified as not material.
The long-term trend towards greater sustainability pro- vides opportunities to boost sales of sustainable prod- ucts and, under the right circumstances, achieve better selling prices. Innovations – such as the BMW i3 in the field of electromobility or Efficient Dynamics through- out the whole product portfolio – provide excellent plat- forms for future growth.
Potential is also seen by engaging in new product and market categories and by tapping new customer target groups. New business models and cooperation arrange- ments with the BMW Group’s growing network of business partners often provide the best means to take advantage of these opportunities. Working together with other business partners helps to increase market coverage, expand the range of solutions on offer and encourage the development of forward-looking tech- nologies. Good examples of this are the partnerships and programmes comprising the 360° ELECTRIC port- folio in the field of electromobility and collaboration with Toyota on a hydrogen fuel cell system. Coopera- tions of this kind generally result in greater availability of a wider range of new technologies for the customer and increase the likelihood of a successful market launch in the long term. The short- to medium-term impact of such activities is generally not material.
Given the long lead times involved in developing new products and processes, strategic and sector-specific opportunities are not expected to have a material short- term impact on the earnings performance of the BMW Group.
Opportunities from operational activities
Employees make a vital contribution to sustainable growth and improved profitability through their inno- vative skills. The BMW Group is constantly refining the tools it uses to recruit employees, encourage career development and bind employees to the enterprise. Within this environment, employees find the optimal environment in which to develop their skills. If these measures generate greater benefits than currently expected, the BMW Group’s revenue, earnings perfor- mance and cash flows could be positively impacted and forecasted figures surpassed. Creating a successful
78
 
79 CoMBinedManageMentRepoRt
performance culture and the development of the skill- sets of both staff and managers alike throughout the or- ganisation could also have a positive impact on revenues and profitability. Compared to the outlook, the BMW Group’s earnings performance is unlikely to benefit from efficiency improvements to a significantly greater ex- tent than that incorporated in the outlook.
Further opportunities may arise due to other technical innovations relating to products and processes and as
a result of organisational changes. In the field of light- weight construction, carbon is being put to use in high volumes for the first time in the automobile industry in the construction of the BMW i3. The potential for effi- ciency improvements in this area is quite considerable, including the increased use of this material in other vehi- cle projects, as a result of which the competitiveness of the products involved – both in terms of consumption and driving dynamics – could be improved to a signifi- cantly greater extent than originally planned. The op- portunities presented by these new developments are primarily relevant for the medium to long term and will not have a material short-term impact on the BMW Group’s earnings performance.
The BMW Group focuses its selling capacities primarily on markets with the greatest sales volume and revenue potential and fastest growth rates. Investment in exist- ing and new marketing concepts is firmly aimed at in- tensifying relationships with customers. A good exam- ple is the new marketing concept for BMW i products and services, which will be offered in selected markets in the future via an innovative multi-channel model. There will be no let-up in the active search for new op- portunities to create even greater added value for cus- tomers than currently expected, whilst at the same time looking for ways to boost sales volumes and achieve better selling prices.
Developments in the field of digital communication are also opening up opportunities for marketing the BMW Group’s various brands. Consumers can meanwhile be reached on a more targeted and individual basis, thus helping to strengthen long-term relationships and brand loyalty. The BMW Group keeps track of the latest developments and trends in communication technology, including the use of social media and networks, in order to extend customer reach. The BMW Group’s brands are present on numerous platforms, such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Thanks to its intensive efforts in
this area, the BMW Group is registering faster growth rates on the various platforms than its competitors, measured in terms of the number of fans and visits. The decisive advantage of digital communication is that the brands are able to engage in a direct dialogue with customers and thus create a more intense brand expe- rience. The BMW Group considers that these opportu- nities will not have a material impact compared to the assumptions made in the outlook.
Pension benefits represent an important component of the BMW Group’s overall remuneration package, mak- ing it easier to recruit qualified staff and to gain them for the enterprise on a long-term basis. Pension liabili- ties are matched in part by corresponding pension plan assets. Within a favourable capital market environment, the return generated by pension assets may exceed expectations and reduce the deficit of the relevant pen- sion plans. This, in turn, could have a materially favour- able impact on the net assets position and earnings per- formance of the BMW Group. Pension plan assets also help to reduce the interest and inflation risks attached to pension liabilities.
Financial opportunities arising from currencies
and raw materials
The ability to compete on global markets is also signifi- cantly influenced by changes in exchange rates and raw materials prices. Favourable developments in exchange rates (in particular for China and the USA) and in raw materials prices could have a positive impact on the financial result of the BMW Group. Developments on the financial markets are closely monitored, in order to identify and make the best use of any opportunities that may arise. Financial opportunities are managed by employing the same processes and methodologies used to manage financial risks. The principal objective of these management processes is to reduce risk by improv- ing forecasting reliability. Currency and raw material price opportunities could have a material impact on the earnings performance of the BMW Group.
